AKT price rose by around 50% over the last 24 hours in a bid to hit the crucial $7 mark. This explosive surge comes in when the largest of cryptos are struggling to keep up and deal with the hovering selling pressure.Akash Network, the top gainerData shows that the recent 50% spike has added to the positive momentum already building among the Akash Network’s community. AKT price had jumped by more than 60% in the last 7 days, while, it is up by 134% on the year to date (YTD) basis.However, this surge is recorded as the AKT token bagged a much anticipated listing on the South Korean exchange Upbit.

Its 24 hour trading volume skyrocketed by more than 3220% to stand at $144 million. It is holding a market cap of $1.31 billion.

SOL’s chart is definitely in a good place right now, with its indicators continuing to signal ongoing growth.After taking a dip earlier this morning, SOL’s relative strength index (purple) has just climbed over 50 and looks ready for another ascent towards 70.Source: TradingViewSomething similar applies to the coin’s 30-day average (orange), which rose above the 200-day (blue) a couple of days ago and still has space to rise further.Another bullish sign comes from SOL’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels, which are not only rising but also converging towards each other at a higher level.This could suggest that a big jump isn’t too far away, with Solana’s trading volume currently standing at a healthy $3.2 billion.🚨 134,509 (20,738,302 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) However, there are signs that whales may still be in selling mode, meaning that the Solana price could dip once or twice before we see a concerted recovery.That Solana and the wider market are both a little shaky right now is perhaps not surprising, given that last week’s Bitcoin halving has put pressure on miners.We’re also in the middle of an unsettled period in terms of macroeconomics, with .Still, such cuts will arrive sooner or later, while the last Bitcoin halving will – if history is any guide – gradually boost demand.This will help the Solana price return to growing ways, with the coin remaining one of the strongest in terms of its fundamentals.Indeed, , having risen by over 800% since November as demand has grown for SOL-based meme coins and NFTs.$8,000,000 in solana nft volume in the last 24 hours — degen poet (@solanapoet) Such trends will push the coin’s price higher, potentially reaching $300 by the final quarter of the year.Newer Meme Tokens For Market-Beating Gains While Solana is one of the strongest and most established alts in the market right now, many traders may want to diversify into newer, smaller-cap coins as well.This can maximize their exposure to potential upside, with a handful of newer tokens currently holding presales that could end with them rallying big.For instance, Slothana (SLOTH) is a Solana-based coin that has raised more than $10 million in its hugely popular presale.🚀 Hold onto your branches, Slothana faithful! 🌿 We're gearing up to drop some major news: the official launch date is on the horizon! ⏰ Get ready to mark your calendars and set your alarms, because a countdown timer will soon grace our site.

       "  'title': 'Ethereum Resurgence: TRON Founder Justin Sun Goes On 127,388 ETH Buying Spree',\n",
       "  'description': 'The second-largest crypto token by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), looks set to make a massive market recovery following recent buys suspected to be made by Tron’s founder, Justin Sun. Sun’s accumulation spree again highlights crypto whales’ recent bullishness on Ethereum despite fluctuating prices.\\xa0Sun Allegedly Buys $405 Million Worth Of ETHIn an X (formerly Twitter) post, the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain drew the crypto community’s attention to a mysterious wallet suspected to belong to Justin Sun. This wallet is said to have bought 127,388 ETH ($405.19 million) from Binance and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since April 8 at an average price of $3,127. Meanwhile, Lookonchain tried to prove further its theory that this wallet likely belonged to Justin Sun. The platform alluded to a previous tweet mentioning that a suspected Justin Sun wallet bought 168,369 ETH at $2,894 from Binance and a DEX between February 12 and 24. It noted that the “transaction behavior” of both wallets was similar, which suggests that they are both likely owned by Justin Sun.\\xa0If indeed both wallets are owned by Justin Sun, that means the Tron founder has accumulated 295,757 ETH ($891 million) at an average price of $3,014 since February 12. Like every whale activity, Sun’s alleged transactions have caught the crypto community’s attention, with many wondering why he is gaining so much exposure to the second-largest crypto token.\\xa0Ethereum Whales Are BullishSun’s actions highlighted the bullish sentiment that Ethereum whales have towards the crypto token despite its recent unimpressive price action. Bitcoinist recently reported about an Ethereum whale who, despite already losing $4.5 million, opened another long position on the second-largest crypto token.\\xa0This whale also borrowed 17.3 million USDT just to increase their exposure to the crypto token. In a recent X post, Lookonchain again highlighted how Ethereum whales are still making bullish moves in the market. On-chain data shows a fresh wallet (0x9EB0) that withdrew 7,182 ETH ($23.06 million) from Binance, which suggests long-term holding by this whale.\\xa0Another wallet (0x1958) withdrew 5,181 ETH ($16.28 million) from Binance and put their ETH holdings to work by staking it into Bedrock and Pendle while anticipating further price gains in the crypto token.Such bullish sentiment towards Ethereum could be good for ETH’s price as whales are known to have a significant impact on a token’s price discovery. It could also prove crucial during this period when Ethereum is experiencing declining network growth, which means that the rate at which new users come into the ecosystem has slowed.\\xa0At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,170, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum On-Chain Health Holds Strong Amidst Open Interest Plunge – Impact On Price',\n",
       "  'description': 'Ethereum (ETH) stands as a bellwether for the industry’s ebbs and flows. As of press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,174, its price trying to reach the crucial $3,000 mark. However, beneath the surface of these seemingly stable waters lies a complex interplay of market forces and investor sentiment.Ether’s Challenging TrajectorySince last week, the lower timeframes have seen repeated breaches of the $3,000 psychological threshold, and the enthusiasm surrounding the altcoin king has significantly waned.This downward pressure is further underscored by the notable drop in Open Interest (OI) behind ETH futures contracts, which plummeted from $10 billion to $7 billion in April alone.Such a decline suggests a recalibration in the futures market, potentially signaling a cooling-off period for speculative trading activity.Navigating Choppy WatersHowever, amidst the uncertainty, there exists a glimmer of hope for ETH bulls. Historical precedents, such as the mid-February 2021 correction, offer insight into the resilience of Ethereum’s price.Following a similar dip from an all-time high of $1,900 to $1,400, Ethereum experienced a V-shaped reversal, demonstrating the market’s propensity for swift recoveries. This historical context serves as a guiding light for investors navigating the choppy waters of cryptocurrency volatility.Ethereum: Fundamental MetricsOn the social sentiment front, Ethereum’s trajectory has been a tale of two halves. While sentiment was strongly positive in February and briefly in mid-March, a negative sentiment has dominated as prices entered a correction phase. Factors such as high gas fees on the Ethereum network have likely contributed to this shift, highlighting the impact of practical considerations on market sentiment.Examining Ethereum’s fundamental metrics provides further insights into its current state. Network growth has slowed in recent months, signaling a potential decline in demand. However, a closer look reveals a silver lining: the 90-day mean coin age has trended steadily higher since late March, indicating a network-wide accumulation of ETH.As Ethereum continues to navigate these turbulent waters, all eyes are on key resistance levels. Breaking above the $3,300 barrier could instill confidence among traders and investors, potentially heralding a new wave of bullish momentum. However, uncertainties loom large, particularly in light of the broader market dynamics and the selling pressure on Bitcoin, Ethereum’s perennial counterpart.While challenges abound and uncertainties persist, Ethereum’s historical performance and fundamental strengths offer hope for a brighter future. As investors brace for potential headwinds and opportunities alike, Ethereum stands poised to weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side.Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView',\n",

       "  'title': 'DAO Maker hack victims still await reimbursement 3 years later',\n",
       "  'description': 'The DAO Maker crypto fundraising platform, not to be confused with the MakerDAO stablecoin protocol, is attempting to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund new Web3 projects in 2024. However, victims of its August 2021 hack say the project never reimbursed them for the losses they suffered in the attack, even though its development team promised to make all victims whole again.\\xa0Victims also claim that DAO Maker is liable for these losses, as the hack was allegedly the result of a private key compromise suffered due to its developers’ negligence. per person. The remaining compensation was to be paid through an IOU token called “USDR.” This token would become redeemable for the protocol’s native coin, DAO, at prevailing prices within one year.DAO Maker was first exploited in August 2021, when approximately $7 million of users’ funds were stolen. The development team later acknowledged that the exploit had occurred because of a private key hack. At the time, it agreed to partially compensate investors with an immediate airdrop of 500 USD Coin However, victims of the hack told Cointelegraph that USDR redemptions were never allowed and that they still have not been compensated for their remaining losses. In addition, decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher SOMA Analytics has claimed that DAO Maker forced through a proposal with its governing body to cancel the reimbursement plan, using its large token supply to ensure the vote’s outcome. According to the researcher, the proposal was deleted after its passage, allegedly as part of an attempt by the team to remove evidence of its failure to reimburse victims.DAO Maker, based in Prague, is completely separate from and has no relation to the similarly named MakerDAO stablecoin protocol.DAO Maker gets hacked and offers compensationDAO Maker is a fundraising platform for technology startups, with a particular focus on raising money for Web3 protocols governed by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). According to its official website, the protocol signed on “more than 75,000 retail users interested in early-stage ventures” in 2020 and has “200,000+ KYC’ed users.”As per CoinMarketCap’s description of DAO Maker, the project\\xa0offers several different systems for investors to participate in new token offerings. One is called a “Strong Holder Offering (SHO),” wherein investors purchase DAO tokens and use them to allocate “DAO Power” to a particular coin offering. The more DAO Power they allocate, the more likely they are to win a participation slot for a particular offering.If they win a slot, “their allocation will be automatically funded by their USD Coin (USDC) balance” and the investor will be allowed to use these funds to purchase coins in the offering, CoinMarketCap states. The description cites official DAO Maker documents that have since gone offline.What is a crypto launchpad, and how does it work?Related: In the 2021 hack, the SHO contract holding these USDC funds was exploited, and $7 million was stolen. In a Medium post on Aug. 12, 2021, the DAO Maker team acknowledged that the hack was caused by “malicious use of one of our wallets with access to admin privileges.”On Aug. 17, in a separate Medium post, the team announced a plan to compensate investors. The announcement was also\\xa0shared on the team’s official Telegram channel. The team claimed it would airdrop 500 USDC immediately to each investor impacted by the hack.\\xa0On Sept. 8, 2021, the remaining losses would be covered through an “IOU token” called USDR. One year later, on Aug. 8, 2022, each USDR token would be redeemable for $1 at a 1:1 ratio plus 10% interest denominated in DAO tokens. “Each USDR token is equal to 1.1 worth of DAO, 1 year after it is airdropped,” the announcement stated.As an example of how the redemption process would work, the plan considered a user who had lost $1,000 in the hack. This person would “receive 500 USDR tokens on September 8, 2021. [...] After 1 year, they can be redeemed for $550 worth of DAO tokens,” DAO Maker stated.Both Medium posts were later deleted, but archived versions are still available on the Wayback Machine.Victims claim USDR redemptions were never allowedDAO Maker investors told Cointelegraph that the project’s promise to redeem each USDR for $1.10 was never honored by the DAO Maker decentralized autonomous organization nor by its development team.One investor Cointelegraph spoke with, who used the username “Red Drac” on Telegram and spoke on the condition that their real name not be revealed, claimed they lost $2,000 from the hack. They said they deposited $2,000 in stablecoins\\xa0to a “pre-deposit” contract. But when the August 2021 hack occurred, this contract was drained, and they lost all of it. Red Drac stated that after the compensation plan was announced, they received 500 USDT (USDT) — and that they also received 1,500 USDR at a later date. However, the USDR was never allowed to be redeemed for DAO as promised.According to Red Drac, they eventually discovered that a liquidity pool for USDR existed and that they could sell into this pool to cash out early. However, the tokens “were not in a 1:1 ratio to USDT.” Instead, the tokens were being sold at “something like 80%” of their par value. As a result, Red Drac did not sell their USDR into the pool, and these tokens are still sitting in their wallet today. He claimed that this USDR is nearly worthless now, as there is presently no way to exchange it for other cryptocurrencies. The previously existing liquidity pool was later shut down, leaving holders with no means to cash out. Red Drac acknowledged that they can use the tokens to gain DAO Power within the DAO Maker platform, but they claimed that the tokens “are not that much value because those allocations [don’t] guarantee me that I will actually earn something.”Telegram user Zztelecom told a similar story, claiming they received 500 USDR as compensation for their loss from the hack. Months later, the token began trading for $0.60 to $0.80 per coin. With such a high discount, they decided to buy roughly 10,000 coins, which they expected to be able to redeem for $10,000 worth of DAO once the tokens became redeemable.But the tokens never became redeemable and are now worthless on the secondary market.\\xa0\\xa0“The DAO Maker team decided to fool everyone,” Zztelecom said. “Trading stopped. [...] In the end, they said that each USDR = 1 DAO Power and we can participate in sales with their help, but we cannot send them to other wallets because DAO Power will be lost.”DeFi protocol Unizen to provide ‘immediate reimbursement’ after $2.1M hackRelated: Claims of a DAO Maker cover-upIn addition to these claims from victims, DeFi researcher SOMA Analytics claimed to have evidence that the team tried to cover up its abandonment of the USDR redemption process. The researcher published the work via a Notion workspace and is unaffiliated with the nutritional supplement blog of the same name. According to SOMA, the DAO Maker team created a proposal to abandon the redemption process for USDR. This proposal was allegedly passed by DAO Maker — but was then deleted from its Snapshot webpage. They claimed that the DAO Maker team likely used its own tokens to outvote the majority of tokenholders, ensuring the vote would turn out the way it wanted. It allegedly distributed tokens to new wallets in an attempt to obfuscate its role in the proposal’s passage.“Between October 3rd and October 5th, [2022], a unique USDR proposal surfaced on DAO Maker’s official Discord from some user named @Dante.eth,”\\xa0the researcher stated. SOMA claimed that this proposal has since been deleted but was copied by other community members. According to this copied version, the mysterious user Dante.eth argued that redeeming USDR would have “a massive impact on the price of $DAO for everyone and the token price might never recover.” Purportedly for this reason, the user called for a vote that offered three options for the redemption process. The original proposal to redeem USDR for DAO at a 1:1 rate was not one of the options listed.Option 1 was for the decentralized autonomous organization to algorithmically sell DAO tokens and airdrop USDC to holders of USDR at a 1:1 rate. This would have allowed holders to be fully compensated, but with stablecoins instead of DAO tokens. Option 2 was to distribute DAO tokens from a Venture Yield partnership to USDR holders once a year. Option 3 was to redeem USDR at only 50% of its par value. The option to redeem at 50% of par value (Option 3) passed, with 61.72% of tokens being used to vote in favor of it. However, the researcher claimed these 61.72% of votes were cast by only six wallet accounts. The majority of accounts voted for Option 1, but these small holders reportedly did not possess enough tokens to outvote the six whales that voted for the 50% haircut.The hack victims acknowledged that the USDR token allows them to obtain DAO Power, which gives them a greater chance of participating in token offerings they are interested in.Yet despite the DAO vote for a 50% redemption, SOMA Analytics claimed that even this compensation was never distributed by the team. “From what I recall, there was never any claim portal, and people got simply nothing,” they stated in a message. Instead, according to their report, the team allegedly decided to make USDR unredeemable and allow holders to gain DAO power with it instead. The DAO Power that can be gained from the tokens is not transferable, making the token essentially worthless in the secondary market today.According to SOMA Analytics, the six wallets that voted for the 50% haircut “were created just 10 days before the voting, received substantial amounts of DAO within the same two days (with funds possibly obfuscated through a CEX), and voted exclusively for Option 3.” In their view, this provided a strong indication that the wallets were created by some person or group that was holding a large percentage of the DAO token’s total supply, such as the protocol’s development team. It also indicated that whoever voted for the proposal did not want their identity to be known, as they went through the trouble of creating new wallets solely to participate in the vote.Cointelegraph could not independently confirm which wallets voted for the proposal, when they were created, or how they were funded, as the proposal has been deleted.Cointelegraph contacted the DAO Maker team for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\\xa0DAO Maker continues to provide fundraising services to Web3 startups. According to CoinMarketCap, the DAO token has a market cap of $153 million, making it among the top 400 cryptocurrencies.Related:\\xa0DAO Maker founder builds game based on abandoned Logan Paul project in just 30 days',\n",

Welsh began working for the securities regulator as a trial attorney in December 2022, while Watkins served as an attorney at the Division of Enforcement since January 2022.

Recently, three covert crypto mining operations, suspected of electricity thefts, were uncovered in shophouses and residential homes in Miri region.Representatives from the Sarawak police and Sarawak Energy plant revealed estimated monthly losses of 30,000 Ringgit ($6,276) for the utility company, for stealing electricity to power Bitcoin mining operations.Per a , the investigation team has seized over 70 cryptocurrency mining servers and other devices found on site.Further, they discovered that some crypto mining operators directly tapped electricity cables to avoid meters and thus obtain power illicitly.The investigations are still in process under the country’s Section 33(5) of the Electricity Ordinance, the report added. If convicted, the violators will face a maximum fine of 200,000 Ringgit ($42,000) or up to 5 years in jail.Sarawak has one of the most competitive electricity tariffs, driving crypto operators to set up mining operations in the state. However, per reports, these operations often involve non-standard and unsafe wiring posing serious risks including short circuits, fires, appliance damage, and even loss of life.“Sarawak Energy remains committed to ongoing collaboration with the Ministry of Utility and Telecommunication (MUT) and law enforcement agencies to combat power theft, particularly in cases involving cryptocurrency mining, which has resulted in significant financial losses for the company.”Over Half of Crypto-Linked Power Thefts Found in Sarawak’s Miri Region Per the investigation team, over half of crypto-related electricity theft cases in Sarawak were found in the region of Miri.“Out of the 260 cases uncovered in Sarawak since 2018, approximately 60% (156 cases) were discovered in Miri,” it noted.Last September, Sarawak Energy identified two illegal crypto mining sites, causing recurrent power disruption in a few areas. These electricity thefts have resulted in a monthly loss of around 4 million Ringgit ($837K) for Sarawak Energy.',\n",

       "  'title': '“Bitcoin Is No Longer ‘Cheap’ and Is Considered To Be Trading at ‘Fair’ Value”: Fidelity Digital Assets Report',\n",
       "  'description': 'On April 22, Fidelity Digital Assets released its Q1 2024 Signals Report, providing valuable insights into the performance and dynamics of the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The report highlights the significant impact of Bitcoin’s 2024 halving and Ethereum’s Deneb-Cancun upgrade on their respective networks and the broader cryptocurrency market.According to the report, Bitcoin experienced a strong start to the year, with a 64% price increase by mid-March, just short of Ethereum’s impressive 74% run. However, since then, Bitcoin has retraced 2%, while Ethereum has fallen by approximately 19%. Source: TradingViewSource: TradingViewThe report indicates that the high fee environment has subsided, but elevated spot prices and the anticipation of the 2024 halving have incentivized miners to take profits, contributing to the current sell pressure.Despite the selling pressure, the report highlights positive developments for Bitcoin. The short-term outlook remains positive, with the price trading above the 200-day moving average and maintaining a position 156% higher than the realized price. The golden cross formed on October 30, 2023, also indicates a favorable market sentiment. However, long-term holders are adding to the selling pressure, and 99% of addresses are in profit, which could incentivize selling if the price reaches an all-time high.Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity argues that on the Ethereum front, the Deneb-Cancun upgrade, which took place on March 13, has significantly impacted the network’s fundamentals. The report suggests that users may be pleased with the results thus far, as Ethereum experienced a 55% price increase in Q1 and has shown positive short-term price signals and growing on-chain metrics. Fidelity says the short-term outlook for Ethereum remains positive, with the price trading above the 200-day moving average and the golden cross formed on November 21, 2023, indicating favorable market sentiment.The Ethereum network has maintained a higher rate of burn than issuance since the implementation of The Merge in September 2022, resulting in the removal of nearly 450,000 ETH from the network. Additionally, the number of validators staking on the network has increased by 8% since January, matching the growth rate seen in Q4 2023. Layer 2 adoption has accelerated significantly post-Deneb-Cancun, with Layer 2 transactions making up 80% of all transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem and fees from Layer 2 platforms dropping substantially.The report also highlights the growing interest in staking, with an 8% increase in Q1 developers introducing a churn limit cap in March. It claims this change aims to benefit long-term network health by making it easier for lower resource nodes to participate effectively in staking. It goes on to say the net-negative issuance, showing growth in staked Ether, as well as base layer and Layer 2 usage, increases bode well for Ether’s long-term deflationary potential.Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFeatured Image via Pixabay',\n",

       "  'title': 'Is Bitcoin Halving 2024 a Game-Changer for Investors? Find Out What Experts Predict',\n",
       "  'description': \"Bitcoin halvings are a significant event in the world of cryptocurrencies. A halving occurs approximately every four years and has a direct impact on the issuance rate of new Bitcoins. Here’s how it works:Pre-halving nervousness: Prior to the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin experienced a significant price decline in the month leading up to the event. This trend has been observed in several halving events (with the exception of the recent 2024 halving). However, the market tends to react with optimism, anticipating the positive effects of reduced coin issuance.Why halving matters: Halving events are crucial because they directly impact the supply of new Bitcoins. By reducing the issuance rate, halvings contribute to Bitcoin’s scarcity, making it a deflationary asset. This scarcity is one of the factors that contribute to Bitcoin’s value.The halving mechanism: Bitcoin’s block reward halves every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). Initially, miners received 50 Bitcoins per block, but after the first halving, this reward decreased to 25 Bitcoins. The halving in May 2020 further reduced the reward to 6.25 Bitcoins per block. During the last halving on April 19, the reward dropped to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. The total amount of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million coins, after which no more new tokens will be issued.In the night between April 19 and April 20, the 840,000th block was added to the Bitcoin blockchain, marking the occurrence of the fourth Bitcoin halving. During the halving, the Bitcoin price temporarily reacted with a small decrease, dropping to $63,564 on April 20. At the time of writing, the price is up slightly to $66,301.Bitcoin Hits Record High Before 2024 Halving Before the 2024 Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a rally. Since the beginning of the year alone, Bitcoin’s price surged by 52%, and over the past twelve months, it recorded an impressive 134% increase. The cryptocurrency reached a preliminary peak of its rally on March 13, 2024, setting a new record high at $73,605.\\xa0However, as Easter weekend approached, buying interest waned slightly. On April 1, the most valuable cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,500. Later in the week, the cryptocurrency rebounded and reached $72,572 on April 8, marking the highest level since mid-March. On April 14, Bitcoin plummeted below $62,000 because the crypto markets reacted sharply to major geopolitical shifts. Within just 30 minutes of the official confirmation of the Iran attacks on Israel, Bitcoin lost over 10% of its value. This decline also meant that Bitcoin had shed more than 20% from its recent all-time high.Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, also fell by around 10%, dropping below the key $3,000 mark.Over this weekend, not only cryptocurrencies but also stock markets reacted nervously to Iran’s attacks on Israel. As stock and bond markets are closed on weekends, it was obvious that investors would sell cryptocurrencies if new geopolitical tensions arose over the weekend, Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, on X. “Bitcoin remains the most volatile asset in the planet.”Understandably, people argue about the hedging characteristics of , which remains the most volatile asset on the planet. Also true, with markets closed on weekends, including Bitcoin ETFs, what else is there to sell when geopolitical tensions spike? — jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) The strong price reaction in the crypto markets also has to do with the fact that many crypto investors are leveraged, a hedge fund manager . This means that when times are good, they make particularly large gains, but when things go down, the losses are particularly pronounced.During the next week, the price of Bitcoin recovered a bit, and on April 19, the cryptocurrency’s valuation reached $66.351 per Bitcoin.24h7d30d1yAll timeBitcoin’s Rise in Adoption\\xa0 Bitcoin has seen a significant increase in adoption and recognition this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin spot ETFs for the first time earlier this year, making it much easier for numerous traders to invest in the cryptocurrency. This development also contributed to the positive performance of the BTC price before the halving. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a substantial surge in trading volume during March, reaching an impressive $111 billion. This represented a notable increase, nearly three times the trading volume reported in February ($42.2 billion).\\xa0MARCH MADNESS: Bitcoin ETFs traded $111b in March, which is just about triple what they did in Feb and Jan. I added the months where only GBTC was on market for further context. I can't imagine April will be bigger but who knows.. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) Impact of the 2024 Halving on Bitcoin Price It is expected that the halving will have a long-term positive effect on the Bitcoin price. Historically, the halving event has usually been followed by an upward movement in the price of the cryptocurrency. A look at Bitcoin’s price history on the day of the reward halving and 365 days later confirms this trend.During the first halving in 2012, the BTC price was $12. A year later, it had surpassed the $1,000 mark. During the 2016 halving, the Bitcoin price was $648, and 365 days later, it had climbed to around $2,500. In 2020, during the third halving, the Bitcoin price was by $8,572. A year later, one coin was worth nearly $56,000. How high Bitcoin could go after this year’s halving remains uncertain for now.4th halving 2024-04-20 00:09 UTC 63,976.64 — ChartsBTC (@ChartsBtc) Mining Landscape Impact Revenue earned from Bitcoin mining the $100 million mark for the first time, recording an all-time high daily earnings on Bitcoin halving day, 2024.On April 20, Bitcoin miners a total of $107.7 million in mining rewards and transaction fees as community members willingly paid exorbitant fees to get their transactions recorded on the 840,000th Bitcoin block.Total value in USD of block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners during the last three months. Source: Blockchain.comGenerally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving is expected to have significant effects on miners, the network, and the overall market, primarily due to the power costs associated with energy-intensive mining equipment. Miners will need to adapt to these changing conditions, and investors should closely monitor developments during this critical period.Running mining rigs consumes a substantial amount of energy, which constitutes the largest expense for miners. On average, power costs account for 75-85% of a miner’s total cash operating expenses. Currently, the average power cost in the listed universe is around $0.04 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).After the halving, the reward per block decreased from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Global investment manager VanEck in its report that the all-in cash costs for the top 10 listed miners will be approximately $45,000 per Bitcoin. While larger miners with lower per-coin costs may see their profit margins shrink, they should remain profitable, especially if Bitcoin’s price increases.\\xa0The halving often leads to industry consolidation, with smaller miners struggling while larger players expand their market share. Publicly traded miners already control a significant percentage of the hash rate, according to VanEck’s report.\\xa0Next Halving Expected in 2028 The next reward halving is expected to take place in 2028. During this halving, the block reward goes from 3.125 to 1.5625 BTC. The reward reduction intends to ensure that the maximum amount of 21 million Bitcoins is not reached too quickly.Additionally, the halving is intended to prevent price inflation, as the supply of available coins increases more slowly while demand remains the same or even increases. The inflation rate of Bitcoin after the latest halving is estimated to be around 0.84%. Currently, it is assumed that the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140. However, there are still 25 more halvings to come until then.Bitcoin Price Predictions Various crypto experts have already predicted how Bitcoin could develop after the halving event. Youwei Yang, Chief Economist of Bitcoin mining company BIT Mining, believes Bitcoin could reach $75,000 over the course of the year, as by CNBC. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency exchange CoinShares considers an increase to $80,000 possible.\\xa0Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, even sees Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark, a sentiment shared by Standard Chartered.Jurrien Timmer, the Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, thinks the value of a single Bitcoin could reach $1 billion by the year 2038-2040. But that’s not all the bullish predictions: The analysis company Matrixport believes that the Bitcoin price could climb to $125,000 by the end of the year. Venture capitalist Tim Draper sees potential for $250,000. Seth Ginns of CoinFund is perhaps the most optimistic. He has the “reasonable expectation” that the cryptocurrency a price between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2024. However, he also believes that a price of one million US dollars per coin is conceivable in “this next cycle.”In conclusion, the Bitcoin halving event has historically had a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin, and many experts believe that this trend will continue in the future, with the price potentially reaching new all-time highs.\\xa0However, it’s also essential to consider a broader context, including adoption, regulation, macroeconomic conditions and technological advancements, when predicting Bitcoin’s future price movements.A Comprehensive Bitcoin Price Prediction:Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034\",\n",

The downtrend in volume could be a red flag, suggesting that the recent price increase might be running out of fuel. Volume often confirms trends on the market, and the absence of it during the uptrend is an issue. A price increase on low volume can indicate a lack of commitment from buyers and, sometimes, that the current price action may not be sustainable.If it can gather the strength to push past the 26 EMA resistance, which is around $3,236, we could see a more definitive move toward higher levels. However, if it fails to, there is a risk of a slip back to lower prices. The next significant level of support lies around $2,890, which could serve as a landing spot for the price.The immediate future of Ethereum is uncertain. There's a need for increased trading volume, as it would support the current rally. Without it, the recent break above $3,000 might not lead to the performance that many hope for.While Ethereum has made some gains, the current trading volume raises questions about the longevity of its run above $3,000. Without a convincing surge in the trading volume and market liquidity, the possibility of a rally continuation is almost nonexistent.\",\n",

However, it has also been observed that since March 1, 2024, FTX and Alameda have deposited a total of 20,350 Ethereum worth $72.5 million into different centralized exchanges. Since then, Ethereum’s price has continuously fallen and struggled to gain momentum.Besides this massive recent ETH deposit, earlier on April 9, 2024, both of these firms deposited over 4,000 ETH worth $14.75 million to Coinbase at an average price of $3,688, as reported by Todayq News. Despite this massive ETH dumping on CEX, one thing that is also gaining massive attention is the recent accumulation of Ethereum by a crypto wallet linked to Justin Sun.

       "  'title': 'Venezuela’s Oil Giant Turns to Crypto as US Sanctions Bite Again',\n",
       "  'description': 'Prompted by renewed US oil sanctions, Venezuela’s state-controlled oil company PDVSA intends to boost its use of digital currencies in crude oil and fuel exports, on Monday.The development follows reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry after the Biden administration last week refused to renew a license easing restrictions.This forces companies to wind down transactions by May 31 under a general license. It also makes it harder for Venezuela to export oil. The sanctions are a response to President Nicolas Maduro’s failure to fulfill commitments made after an election deal.Reuters reported that PDVSA has been quietly increasing its use of digital currency, particularly Tether (USDT), for oil sales since last year. The move aims to avoid frozen accounts due to US oil sanctions, according to Reuters.Venezuelan oil minister Pedro Tellechea confirmed the country’s openness to using various currencies, including virtual assets, in oil contracts.The oil market has historically revolved around the US dollar. This dominance stems from the “petrodollar” arrangement established in the 1970s. As a result, oil prices are universally quoted invoiced in US dollars, solidifying its position as the standard currency for oil transactions.Venezuela’s Oil Exports Rebound Despite Past Corruption Scandal Venezuela’s oil exports have seen a resurgence under its new oil minister Tellechea. This is despite a corruption scandal at PDVSA uncovered last year involving $21b in oil export receivables (including past crypto transactions).Exports reached a four-year high of 900,000 barrels per day in March, buoyed by US licenses permitting sales. PDVSA has shifted to a new contract model for spot oil deals to mitigate risk from potential future sanctions. Under this model, the firm requires half the value of each cargo to be prepaid in Tether (USDT).Venezuela Enforces Crypto Wallets for Oil Deals Venezuela’s push for digital currency goes beyond just accepting Tether for oil sales. The firm is now reportedly mandating new customers to have a digital wallet holding crypto. The mandate is also enforced on some existing contracts that didn’t previously specify using USDT. This suggests a broader strategic shift towards digital currencies in the oil trade.Earlier this month, authorities arrested former Vice President Tareck El Aissami. He was accused of being the mastermind behind a scheme to embezzle funds from oil sales using crypto.El Aissami had reportedly been evading capture for a year after allegedly converting cash into cryptocurrencies and potentially transferring them to crypto exchange Kraken. This high-profile corruption case has been dubbed the “PDVSA-crypto incident.”',\n",

Alberto Naudon, an advisor to the central bank, said that it was unlikely that a Chilean CBDC would face much competition from “so-called cryptocurrencies.”Naudon said there was a very small probability that Bitcoin (BTC) or other tokens could be “used as money or a means of payment on a massive scale.”Instead, he said that a digital peso would likely face more competition from stablecoins, some of which are “backed by large companies.”Naudon said that “due to their characteristics,” stablecoins “clearly have the potential” to achieve “significant mass adoption.”The media outlet noted that “in many countries” in the Latin American region, people use USD-pegged coins “more widely than BTC.”The bank appears, like many of its international counterparts, to have made something of a U-turn on CBDC policy.Chile’s central bank President Rosanna Costa said plans to extend one of the world’s biggest rate-cutting cycles remain intact as policymakers have already incorporated new global risks into their outlook — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) Back in 2022, the BCCh began and then abandoned a CBDC project, unsure that it would benefit the nation to press ahead with a digital peso rollout.But the bank appears to have changed its tune in 2024, claiming that the response to its survey had convinced it to try again with the CBDC project.The bank said it was moving “in line with the majority of the world’s central banks.”Scores of nations worldwide, including most major countries in the LATAM region, are either set to roll out CBDCs or are actively researching digital fiat projects.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum (ETH) Climbs Back Above $3,000, Massive $70,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Battle Ahead, Cardano (ADA) About to Face Its Biggest Test',\n",
       "  'description': \"ETH ascends past the $3,000 milestone, which changes the sentiment around the second-biggest cryptocurrency back to bullish. This rebound has seen it spring from the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bullish sentiment might be creeping back onto the market. Chart by TradingViewHowever, despite the price hike, there is a noticeable decrease in volume. This dropping interest from traders signals a warning that the current uptrend might not have the momentum to push through the significant resistance levels ahead. One such level to watch is the 50-day EMA, which has previously acted as a barrier for price advances.Zooming in on the daily chart, we see that Ethereum has recently deviated from an ascending channel, indicating a potential shift in trend. While such breakouts can often lead to more volatile moves, the question remains whether this is a temporary detour or the start of a new path.Support levels have formed around the $2,900 region, where the 100-day EMA lies, serving as a springboard for the recent bounce. On the flip side, there is visible resistance at the 50-day EMA, hovering near the $3,200 mark. This moving average may serve as the next battleground between bears and bulls.Looking forward, if Ethereum can sustain its current level and possibly push past the 50-day EMA, it could pave the way for a renewed bullish phase. The critical test will be whether it can ignite enough volume and buyer interest to break past these looming resistance points.Is Bitcoin ready?Bitcoin gears up for another round in the ring, price data shows. The digital gold has recently cut through the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which acts as a gauge for short-term price momentum. This move is more than just numbers changing; it is a sign that Bitcoin might be getting its second wind.The next big showdown is with the 50-day EMA. A break above this average could be the bell that signals a rally cry for Bitcoin bulls, setting the stage for a potential climb toward the all-time high of $100,000. But let's not get ahead of ourselves — the road there is fraught with trials and tribulations.The post-halving period seems to be playing its part well, aiding in the asset's recovery and resilience. With the price now hovering near $63,000, the community whispers about the next psychological barrier: the $70,000 mark.\\xa0Looking at the chart, we see that if the bulls keep pushing, and we cross the 50 EMA, the road to $70,000 could become less of a dream and more of a reality. On the flip side, should Bitcoin take a breather and the bears step in, there is robust support around $59,000, which has previously acted as a strong foundation for the price.The $100,000 milestone remains a distant star, however, considering the amount of liquidity needed to reach that threshold. The future of Bitcoin depends on many factors, and on the current market, it is difficult to foresee.Cardano's surgeCardano is approaching the 200-day EMA — a line that could dictate its trajectory in the short term. Historically, the 200 EMA has served as a benchmark for bullish or bearish market sentiment, and for ADA, it is a moment of truth.ADA's price moves around $0.50, which it has recently breached. This level is now shaping up to be a key support area. Should ADA sustain above it, the focus shifts to whether it can maintain upward momentum.\\xa0Conversely, if ADA fails to hold this ground, the next level of support lies at $0.44, the previous point of reversal and the local low. This level is crucial, as it is where ADA last found strong buying interest, allowing it to pivot and climb.However, the declining volume accompanying ADA’s price movements may cause trouble. Typically, ascending prices paired with descending volume can indicate a lack of commitment from buyers, raising the potential for a pullback.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum To See Fresh Move Soon? What Futures Data Says',\n",
       "  'description': 'Data shows the Ethereum Open Interest has been trading at relatively low levels recently. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price.Ethereum Open Interest Has Been Moving Sideways Since Its PlungeAs explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the ETH Open Interest has followed a similar trajectory as the price of the cryptocurrency recently. The “Open Interest” here refers to the total number of derivative-related contracts open for Ethereum on all exchanges.When the value of this metric goes up, it means that investors are currently opening up new positions on these platforms. Generally, this kind of trend leads to an increase in the market’s total leverage, so the asset price could become more volatile.On the other hand, a decline in the indicator implies the investors are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. Such a drawdown may accompany violent price action, but once the drop is over, the market could become more stable due to the reduced leverage.Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Open Interest over the last few months:As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Open Interest registered a sharp drop earlier alongside the asset’s price. The plunge in the metric was naturally caused by the long contract holders being washed out in the price drawdown.As the price has mostly consolidated sideways since the decline, so has the value of the Open Interest. The quant notes,This alignment suggests a cooling down of activity within the futures market. Consequently, the market appears poised for the resurgence of either long or short positions, potentially initiating a fresh and decisive market movement in either direction.Another indicator related to the derivative market that could be relevant for Ethereum’s future price action is the funding rate. This metric tracks the periodic fees that derivative contract holders are currently paying each other.Positive funding rates imply that the long holders are paying the shorts a premium to hold onto their positions; hence, that bullish sentiment is dominant. Similarly, negative values suggest that a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the derivative traders.The chart below shows that the Ethereum funding rate has recently turned red.Historically, the market has been more likely to move against the opinion of the majority, so the fact that the funding rate has flipped negative may be a good sign for the chances of any potential uptrends to start.ETH PriceEthereum has gradually increased over the last few days, as its price has now reached $3,200.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Investors spent more than 37.7 Bitcoin, worth $2.4 million, in fees to claim their spot on the 2024 Halving Block, making it the most expensive block ever mined.On April 20, at 12:09 p.m. UTC, Bitcoin miner ViaBTC generated the 840,000th block, triggering an automated protocol that cuts per-block Bitcoin (BTC) emissions in half.The event that occurs once every 4 years, known as the Bitcoin Halving, saw mining rewards cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.Revenue earned from Bitcoin mining reached record heights on the day of the halving, hitting $107.7 million in daily earnings as community members willingly paid extortionate fees to get their transactions recorded on the 840,000th Bitcoin block.This resulted in a total of $2.4 million in fees as users competed for the most valuable piece of digital real estate in Bitcoin history. According to , 3,050 transactions occurred, meaning the average user paid a little under $800.One reason for the record fees was an influx as users rushed to engrave and etch unique Satoshis on the halving block.\\xa0The new Runes Protocol, developed by Bitcoin Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor, was the main source of the influx of activity, as it launched simultaneously with the halving.How Did Runes Protocol Make Bitcoin Halving History? Runes have been marketed as a more efficient way to create new tokens on the Bitcoin network, compared to the BRC-20 token standard — an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens.Runes, like BRC-20s, use the Bitcoin network and pay fees in Bitcoin to generate new tokens. However, Runes uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model to “etch” new tokens on Bitcoin. This contrasts with Ordinals’ “inscription” account model, from Rodarmor.\\xa0The protocol lets users inscribe individual satoshis with unique identification numbers, and embed them with arbitrary data directly into Bitcoin’s blockchain.Aside from the battle to inscribe one of the first Runes, Bitcoin mining pools competed for what is known as an “epic” satoshi. An epic satoshi is the very first satoshi, or the smallest possible Bitcoin denomination, mined on the halving block.Given the decrease in Bitcoin mining rewards, many crypto miners have taken a threatening hit to their income, leaving them vulnerable.So far, Bitcoin miners have been making up for the loss of mining rewards following the halving through technological advancements that have improved mining efficiency.However, according to pseudonymous Ordinals developer Leonidas, “Runes degens have single-handedly offset the drop in miner rewards from the halving.”In the last five Bitcoin blocks the fees have surpassed the coinbase reward!The Runes degens have single handedly offset the drop in miner rewards from the halving.Runes are drastically increasing Bitcoin's security budget.You're welcome — Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) According to aggregated data from mempool. space, , excluding miner subsidies, was spent on the five blocks following the halving, signifying a positive future despite the anticipated massive impact the halving would have on Bitcoin Mining Operations.\",\n",

This whale bought over $405 million worth of ETH since March 31 and is suspected to be Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun is also linked to another address that made massive ETH moves this year.A New Whale On The Horizon, Is It Justin Sun?The blockchain research platform Lookonchain revealed that a whale has gone on an Ethereum buying frenzy over the past few weeks.

According to the research platform, the activity from this new address is similar to that of the alleged Justin Sun address.Although the possibility of a coincidence is not ruled out, the activity between the two addressed seems to suggest otherwise. On March 31, the address Sun was suspected of owning made a significant deposit of 787 million USDT to Binance on Tron, which coincided with the withdrawal made by the mysterious new address.As reported by NewsBTC, Justin Sun’s alleged wallet also went on a similar buying spree from February 12 to February 24. At the time, the address acquired 168,396 ETH, worth around $580.5 million, for an average price of $2,894.Lookonchain considers that the similarities hint that these addresses are likely owned by Sun. If so, Justin Sun has bought 295,757 ETH, worth $891 million, in the past two months.Ethereum Price Recovers Amid Whale AccumulationX users expressed concern over Sun’s alleged movements. At the time of the first report, some considered the transaction suspicious.One user affirmed that Sun would be “the reason of the next market crash.” Others believe it was time to question whether Sun would dump his ETH bag. However, the possibility of him accumulating for the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) was brought up.The latest news of Sun’s alleged buying spree received a more positive response. A user considered it a bullish signal for the second-largest cryptocurrency, as the token could benefit from whale accumulation.On Friday, Ether’s price dipped to $2,865, a level not seen since late February. Over the weekend, however, ETH began to recover from its recent fall as the whale buying spree occurred.Since then, the “king of altcoins” regained the $3,100 support level, currently trading at $3,192. The recovery represents a 2% increase from its price 24 hours ago and a 1.5% surge in the weekly timeframe.Moreover, ETH’s daily trading activity has increased by 8.7%, with a daily trading volume of $11.42 billion. Similarly, the second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a 1.78% rise in market capitalization during the last day.',\n",

The SPX has bounced above 5,000, the DXY is going sideways around 106, and 10-year yields are flat at nearly 4.6%.Stabilization in the macro backdrop has allowed Bitcoin and major altcoins to continue their post-halving positive momentum.Assuming macro doesn’t become a major near-term market headwind once again, BTC could soon recover back to recent highs.Bitcoin demand is increasing and the incoming daily supply just got cut in half.Economics 101 tells us the next 12 months should be fun for bitcoin holders. Here is my segment from today. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) Whilst the near-term outlook for blue-chip cryptos is strong, traders looking for fast gains will always turn to on-chain markets.What Are On-Chain Markets? On-chain markets refer to crypto assets issued and traded directly on the blockchain. Ethereum,\\xa0Solana, and\\xa0BNB\\xa0are the most commonly used chains by those issuing or trading on-chain tokens.These on-chain markets are highly illiquid compared to centralized spot\\xa0cryptocurrency exchanges\\xa0or traditional financial markets.That makes them highly volatile. A newly launched coin can easily see gains of 100x in days as its market cap surges from the tens of thousands to millions.Equally, a small amount of sell pressure can trigger huge price drops. And that’s not the only risk.There is virtually no barrier to entry for someone to issue their own token. That means\\xa0scammers flock to the on-chain crypto markets\\xa0to attempt to scam unaware investors.They can do this by inserting malicious code into the token’s\\xa0smart contract\\xa0creating unfair trading conditions.Alternatively, the token might be a\\xa0pump-and-dump scheme. This is where the team behind a token builds up artificial hype to create demand, cash in, and abandon ship.One popular technique is for a token’s issuer to watch the ETH in the token’s liquidity pool rise as the token’s price pumps, only to withdraw and make off with this ETH abruptly.That’s why many on-chain investors look for “locked liquidity,” which prevents\\xa0such rug pull attempts.That said, let’s examine some of the top crypto gainers in Ethereum’s on-chain market today.Top Crypto Gainers TodayRemoteAI (REM)A new AI shitcoin called RemoteAI (REM) has on Monday, as per DEXScreener.The token last had a market cap of around $3.4 million, having seen $425,000 in 24-hour trading volumes.🛑 Scam Detected by 🔸 REM – RemoteAI | 🔸 Contract: 0x0379eb3295add558644d2f7640153081e6821511🔹 — CoinSpeedrun Bot (@CoinspeedrunBot) Traders should be very cautious of this shitcoin.

AMA 🚀Join the and the PredictingAI team for a community AMA held in our very own Telegram.⏰23/Apr/24 at 19:00 UTC.📍 — PredictingAI (@PredictingAI) The token has a 5% buy and sell tax which is modifiable, and ownership hasn’t been renounced. It could easily be a scam, so potential investors should be very careful.Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.An innocent-looking project could easily be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is\\xa0getting involved in crypto presales.The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.Here are 19 of the presale projects with the highest potential.See the 19 CryptocurrenciesAlternatively, check out this video by Cryptonews’ Crypto Arjay, who goes through his top three presales.',\n",

For example, most presales will sell their token at a price that gives them a market cap of $10-30 million.If a good project gains traction, it can easily reach a market cap in the hundreds of millions. So, presale investors can often make as much as 10x or more gains.Of course, investing in new crypto ICOs comes with many of the same risks as traditional start-up investing.

       "  'description': ' price has managed to sustain above the $3,000 line as support for nearly a week before recovering.Ethereum’s Now, with the help of investors’ resilience, the biggest altcoin in the world could further its recovery.Ethereum Investors Will Not SellAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s price is hovering above the $3,000 mark, showing signs of further recovery. One of the biggest contributors to this potential rally is the investors who have opted to HODL instead of selling.This is evident in the sudden decline in the active deposits on the network. Active deposits indicate investors’ intention to sell their assets to gain profits or offset losses.Currently, ETH deposits are at a seven-month low, which is a good sign for the altcoin. This means Ethereum would not be vulnerable to corrections due to selling, giving it room to recover the recent losses.This sentiment is also observed in the shift of supply from short-term investors to mid-term investors. The addresses holding their assets for one to three months have observed an increase of 638,000 ETH worth more than $2 billion.The increase in their supply hints that the short-term investors who hold their assets for less than a month and are prone to selling are finding the potential of profits in the asset and are, hence, holding their supply for now.This bullishness would aid the altcoin to rally to $3,500.ETH Price Prediction: The Crucial FibonacciEthereum’s price is trading at $3,202 when writing, inching closer to $3,376. This price is in confluence with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement of $4,575 to $2,743. Supported by the investors, should ETH breach the 50% Fib resistance, it would be open to continuing this rally.As a result, Ethereum’s price would end up testing the $3,582 resistance, propelling ETH above $3,500, which acts as psychological resistance and support.However, if the 50% Fib barrier is not broken and the altcoin falls back down, failing to breach it, it would likely fall to $3,093. Losing this support would invalidate the bullish outlook, sending Ethereum’s price below $3,000.',\n",

       "  'description': ' declined just 1.1% last week, indicating strength.The S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell 3.05% last week as hopes for a handful of interest rate cuts by the United States Federal Reserve dwindled due to elevated inflation readings. In comparison, Bitcoin Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said in a X post that Bitcoin’s raw electricity cost per mined block is $77,400. He added that Bitcoin’s price remains below the “electrical cost” for only about a couple of days every four years, which means that Bitcoin is “trading at a DEEP DISCOUNT.”Bitcoin is likely to remain volatile in the next few days as the bulls and the bears battle it out for supremacy. If Bitcoin remains range-bound in the near term, it may attract buyers toward select altcoins that may resume their up move. What are the important resistance and support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.S&P 500 Index price analysisThe S&P 500 Index has been correcting for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are rushing to the exit.The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the oversold zone, indicating that the bears are in command. There is a minor support at 4,920, from where the index may witness a rebound.If the price turns down from the 20-day exponential moving average (5,104), the possibility of a drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 4,821 increases. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price rises above the 20-day EMA. The pair may then rise to 5,225.U.S. Dollar Index price analysisThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) turned up from the moving averages and surged above the 105 resistance on April 10, completing an ascending triangle pattern.The bulls continued their purchase and scaled the 106 resistance with ease. That sets up the stage for a rally to 108, where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense. If the price turns sharply lower from 108, it will indicate that the bears are fiercely defending the level. The index may then drop to 105.The first sign of weakness will be a drop and break below the breakout level of 105. If this level cracks, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The index may then descend to the uptrend line.Bitcoin price analysisThe bears are trying to stall Bitcoin’s recovery at the 20-day EMA ($65,858), but the bulls are in no mood to surrender. pair could attempt a rally to $73,777.The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers shove the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($67,511), the If bears want to seize control, they will have to quickly yank the price below the $60,775 support. If they manage to do that, the pair may start a deeper correction to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298.Ether price analysis has risen to the 20-day EMA ($3,234), indicating that the bulls are trying to make a comeback.Ether  pair could slip to $3,056. This is an essential support for the bulls to defend because if it gives way, the next stop could be $2,850.The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the On the upside, a break above the 20-day EMA will strengthen the buyers. The pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($3,481) and later to $3,679. A break above this resistance will suggest that the correction may be over.BNB price analysis rose above the 20-day EMA ($568) on April 20, clearing the path for a possible rally to the overhead resistance at $635.BNB  pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $692 and thereafter climb to the pattern target of $775.The bulls and the bears are likely to witness a tough battle near $635. If bulls prevail, the Instead, if the price turns down sharply from the overhead resistance, it will signal that the bears are in no mood to relent. That may keep the pair stuck between $495 and $635 for a while longer.Solana price analysis has reached the 20-day EMA ($156), where it is likely to face solid resistance from the bears. Solana If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The price could then descend toward the strong support at $126. A break below this level could open the doors for a fall to $100. pair will then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance of $205.On the other hand, if the price continues higher and breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The XRP price analysis recovery has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.54), indicating solid buying by the bulls at lower levels.XRP’s The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the current level, the bears will try to tug the price to the $0.46 to $0.41 support zone. pair may continue to trade inside the large range between $0.46 and $0.74 for several more days.On the contrary, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) has been trading near the support line of the ascending channel pattern for the past few days. pair could start a down move to the 50-day SMA ($4.90).The failure of the bulls to start a strong rebound off the 20-day EMA ($6) suggests a lack of aggressive buying at current levels. That increases the risk of a break below the channel. If that happens, the selling could accelerate, and the Time is running out for the bulls. To prevent the decline, they will have to quickly push the price above $6.50. The pair may then attempt a rally to $7.23 and later to the resistance line. Dogecoin price analysis has been facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($0.16), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.Dogecoin  pair is likely to rise above the moving averages and reach the downtrend line. This is a critical level for the bears to defend because a break above it will indicate that the downward move may be over. The pair could start a rally to $0.21 and subsequently to $0.23.The Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from the moving averages or the downtrend line, it will suggest that the bears remain in charge. The sellers will try to pull the price down to $0.14 and then to $0.12.Cardano price analysis has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.52), which is an important level to watch out for. The bears are likely to defend the level with vigor.Cardano  pair could once again drop to $0.46. A strong bounce off the $0.46 level will suggest that the corrective phase may be over.

       "  'title': ' Crypto investment products see outflows for second consecutive week — CoinShares ',\n",
       "  'description': \"Investments in digital asset funds have declined for the second consecutive week, with $206 million in withdrawals between April 15-19, according to data from digital asset investment firm CoinShares. investment products also experienced outflows of $34 million, marking their sixth consecutive week of negative flow.  funds led outflows over the past week, with $192 million exiting the market ahead of the halving event. Ether Bitcoin Investment in blockchain equities has also been declining, with the sector recording its 11th consecutive week of outflows, totaling $9 million. According to CoinShares, the downtrend is likely a result of investors’ concerns about rising interest rates in the United States, which can make less risky financial instruments more attractive compared to volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies.The Federal Reserve anticipated easing its monetary policy in mid-2024 if economic conditions aligned, but recent inflation data have dampened those hopes. The annual Consumer Price Index in March increased by 3.5%, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive month and indicating that lower rates may not become a reality until 2025. The federal funds rate currently sits between 5.25% and 5.50%. “The data suggests appetite from ETP/ETF investors continues to wane, likely off the back of expectations that the FED is likely to keep interest rates at these high levels for longer than expected.”Trading volume for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) declined slightly to $18 billion over the week. Bitcoin fund outflows, however, were not seen as an opportunity to short the cryptocurrency. According to CoinShares, the trend indicates that while investors are stepping away from volatility, they are not necessarily expecting Bitcoin price to crash anytime soon. “These volumes represent a lower percentage of total Bitcoin volumes (which continue to rise) at 28%, compared to 55% a month ago,” the report said.Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have significantly slowed since their peak in March. Meanwhile, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest ETF in terms of assets managed, maintained a steady level of investor interest this month, drawing $1.4 billion in positive flows as of April 19.1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilitiesMagazine:\\xa0\",\n",

       "  'title': '3 Major Metrics To Watch Out For That Can Impact Ethereum Prices',\n",
       "  'description': 'The crypto market has been plagued with increased volatility lately, with the second largest crypto token by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), not exempt. This has made it harder to determine Ethereum’s future trajectory. However, certain metrics indicate what direction ETH’s price could head in when this volatility subsides.\\xa0Ethereum Investors Are BullishData from Coinglass shows that most Ethereum investors and traders are still bullish on the crypto token despite recent fluctuating prices. Specifically, most of these traders have continued to open long positions on Ethereum, meaning they are betting on it experiencing significant moves to the upside in the long run.\\xa0The bullish sentiment towards Ethereum is highlighted by a trader who, having lost $4.5 million while longing ETH, still opened another long position on the second-largest crypto token. This crypto whale went as far as borrowing 17.3 million USDT from Compound just to increase their position on Ethereum.\\xa0These investors’ bullishness on Ethereum is even more commendable, considering that the bulls have suffered the most from ETH’s high volatility. Data from Coinglass shows that over $16 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, compared to the $10 million short positions that have liquidated during this period.\\xa0Meanwhile, data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has dropped, indicating that many Ethereum holders are not yet in profit. This could be bullish for ETH’s price as these holders will likely hold in anticipation of further upward price action, thereby providing support against any potential price declines.\\xa0Making A Case For The BearsWhile the activity in the derivates market and Ethereum’s MVRV ratio paint a bullish outlook for the crypto token, Ethereum’s network growth suggests that ETH could still experience further price declines. Data from Santiment shows that the rate at which new users enter the Ethereum ecosystem has slowed recently.\\xa0This declining network growth is also evident in a recent Bitcoinist report, which noted that Ethereum fees have dropped to their lowest since January. Ethereum fees are known to skyrocket when there is increased activity on the network. Therefore, low fees mean fewer new users are currently transacting on the network or even holding the ETH token at all.\\xa0However, the silver lining is that data from Santiment also shows an increase in velocity, which suggests that existing users on the network are actively trading and injecting more liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem. This factor could also contribute to potential price surges for the ETH token.\\xa0At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,200, which is up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\\xa0',\n",

SHIB’s chart gives the strong impression that the coin is in the middle of a growth spurt, with its indicators recently climbing and remaining bullish today.Its 30-day average (orange) climbed over its 200-day average (blue) over the weekend and is continuing to move higher, signalling solid buying pressure.Source: TradingViewLikewise, SHIB’s relative strength index (purple) is rising towards 70 again after reaching 80 yesterday and then dipping late last night.That the RSI has quickly recovered after a little correction is a bullish sign, suggesting that the coin is in the middle of a medium-term growth phase.Indeed, SHIB’s trading volume passed $1 billion and remains at $800 million today, representing a 100% increase over its level on Saturday.The main reason for this spike is that, as mentioned above, Shiba Inu has announced a raise of $12 million for its new layer-three chain. Inu has raised $12 million via the token to develop its new privacy-focused Layer 3 blockchainInvestors include Polygon Ventures, Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings and Shima Capital👀— Ajay Kashyap (@EverythingAjay) The funding comes from Polygon Ventures, Animoca Brands, Stake Capital, Mechanism Capital, Big Brain Holdings, Shima Capital, Morningstar Ventures, Woodstock Fund, DWF Ventures, and Comma 3 Ventures.This broad selection of investors signals considerable confidence in the new chain, which will be built on Shibarium and will feature various privacy-enhancing features, incorporating homomorphic encryption technology from Zama.It will also come with its own TREAT token, which will be the last non-stablecoin token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem.This news underlines the growing sense that Shiba Inu is more than a run-of-the-mill meme token, with its developers working hard to improve its utility in recent years (e.g. ).This will all benefit the Shiba Inu price, which could hit $0.00004 in the next few weeks.Newer Meme Tokens Could Show More Upside Potential SHIB remains one of the strongest established meme coins in the market, but it isn’t the only such coin will strong potential.There are also various newer examples with lots of promise, with some of these holding presales that will help them gain momentum prior to listing.Any list of such coins would probably include Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain cryptocurrency that has raised over $9 million in its sale. on the Chain!🚀Advantages:💫 Avalanche's swift confirmations boost the token's usability🔁 Manages large transaction volumes, easing congestionDisadvantages:🔎 Over-reliance might impact decentralization🛡️ Interoperability brings new potential risks — DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) Dogeverse will operate on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base, becoming the first multi-chain Doge-themed crypto in the market.This is extremely bullish for the coin, since the ability to use it on multiple chains could mean that it finds application on many more apps and platforms than it would have otherwise found.In turn, this will boost demand for the coin, with its price also receiving help from its own deflationary tokenomics, with the token’s supply capped at 200 million.It’s also bullish that DOGEVERSE will be open to staking, something which should raise demand further and take a significant portion of its supply out of circulation.Over time, we could therefore see DOGEVERSE rise steadily and substantially, with newcomers able to join its sale now by going to the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.0003, a price which may end up seeming exceedingly low once the token lists in the next few weeks.Buy DOGEVERSE Today\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum Spot ETFs Approval Skepticism Persists, As ETH Recovers',\n",
       "  'description': 'Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval odds continue to witness notable pessimism as the cryptocurrency space awaits the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision on the products scheduled for May.The expectation surrounding the SEC’s decision highlights how important ETF approval is in terms of giving conventional investors more convenient access to Ethereum’s spot market. Presently, data from Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, shows that ETH ETF approval odds have fallen to a mere 11%.Pessimism Deepens As Ethereum ETFs Remain UncertainAs the May deadline draws near, doubt and skepticism loom large on the horizon, casting a dark shadow for the products. One of the most recent figures to voice doubts about the SEC’s willingness to approve the exchange-traded products this May is Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store.According to Geraci, the regulatory watchdog is eerily silent on Ethereum spot ETFs. He further suggested that the products might not be approved due to the SEC’s significantly lower level of engagement with ETF issuers than in previous interactions.“Logic says that is correct, but also wonder if SEC learned a lesson from clown show with spot Bitcoin ETFs,” he added. Thus, he has pointed out two possible options for the products, which are either an approval or lawsuit from the Commission.Commenting on the president’s insights, a pseudonymous X user questioned if there is a possibility that activities are taking place behind closed doors in order to avoid disrupting the pre-launch market. Geraci responded, saying he believes that could be possible, drawing attention to Van Eck CEO Jan Van Eck’s review, which might prove otherwise.It is worth noting that Van Eck is one of the earliest firms to submit its application for an Ethereum exchange product. Even though the company was the first to file for an application, Jan Van Eck is pessimistic about the approval of the ETPs, saying they will probably be rejected in May.He stated:The way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs. And right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned.In light of this, investors prepare for an unpredictable result while managing market swings and modifying their investment plans in the face of changing regulations.ETH Price Sees Positive MovementWhile Ethereum ETFs might be experiencing negative sentiment, ETH, on the other hand, has witnessed a positive uptick lately. ETH has revisited the $3,000 level again after falling as low as $2,888 during the weekend.Today, ETH price rose by over 4%, reaching around $3,234, indicating potential for further price recovery. At the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,215, demonstrating an increase of 1.40% in the past day.Also, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are up by 1.40% and 5.96% in the last 24 hours. Given the anticipated impact of the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving on cryptocurrencies, ETH could be poised for noteworthy moves in the coming months.',\n",

Volatility and RiskWhile both assets are known for their volatility, Nvidia’s stock is backed by a solid business foundation, making it potentially less risky than Bitcoin.\\xa0Nvidia’s performance is closely tied to product demand and innovation in tech sectors, whereas Bitcoin’s value can swing wildly based on less predictable factors like investor sentiment and regulatory changes.It is worth noting that Bitcoin’s volatility is one of its most defining and discussed characteristics, making it both an enticing and risky asset for investors.2. Market PotentialNvidia’s expansion into AI and deep learning presents a clear pathway for growth, especially with the increasing application of these technologies in various industries.\\xa0Likewise, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by regulatory bodies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a strong signal of Bitcoin’s acceptance within the traditional financial system.\\xa0This regulatory nod increases the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a viable investment asset, enhancing investor confidence, particularly among institutional and conservative investors who may have been hesitant to engage with cryptocurrencies due to their unregulated nature.However, Bitcoin also faces uncertainties such as regulatory crackdowns and competition from other cryptocurrencies and even central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).3. Investment ReturnsHistorically, the Return on Investment (ROI) for Bitcoin has been extraordinary, particularly for early investors.Bitcoin’s extreme ROI outpaces traditional assets like stocks and gold by a considerable margin.For perspective, the average annual ROI for the S&P 500, a common benchmark for US stocks, is about 7-10% over most 10-year periods, while gold has appreciated on average about 1-2% above inflation per year over the last 50 years., gold, S&P 500 ROI vs Bitcoin's relatively small size, plus fundamental properties, yield extreme outperformance when even relatively small funds-flows find their way to — CryptoRobinhood (@cryptoMbit) Nvidia’s stock might offer more stable returns, especially as the company continues to innovate and expand its market reach.The Bottom Line Deciding whether Nvidia stock or Bitcoin is a better investment depends on one’s risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in certain technological advancements.\\xa0As we look toward the future, Nvidia stock seems poised to provide sustained growth driven by tangible products and services.\\xa0Bitcoin, while potentially lucrative, carries inherent risks that might deter more conservative investors.\\xa0In short, Nvidia offers a more traditional investment in a high-growth company, while Bitcoin presents a riskier but potentially more lucrative bet on revolutionary financial technology.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Ethereum’s price has been correcting over the last few weeks following a decisive rejection from the $4,000 resistance level back in March. Yet, the market might be about to make a U-turn. Ethereum Price Analysis: Technicals By TradingRage The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has been forming a large descending channel pattern since the beginning of the correction. The lower boundary of the channel has recently been tested and pushed ETH to the upside.The market has also held above the $3,000 support level, and investors are hoping for a rally toward the $3,600 resistance zone in the short term. Yet, so long as the channel remains intact, a further bullish continuation cannot be expected.The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart further clarifies the recent price action. It is evident that the $3,000 support level has prevented the price from dropping any lower, and the market is forming a bottom.The cryptocurrency is currently running toward the midline of the descending channel, and a breakout above would pave the way for the price to attack the $3,600 resistance level once again. With the Relative Strength Index showing values above 50%, the momentum is also in favor of a bullish move in the next few days.Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Ethereum Open Interest The impact of futures market sentiment on significant price movements cannot be underestimated, as the intensity of long and short positions, coupled with the possibility of substantial liquidations, serves as a primary catalyst for market volatility.A crucial indicator in assessing this sentiment is Open Interest, which quantifies the number of open perpetual futures contracts across various cryptocurrency exchanges.In light of Ethereum’s recent downtrend, it is noteworthy that the Open Interest metric has followed a similar trajectory, experiencing a substantial decline. This alignment suggests a slowdown of activity within the futures market.Consequently, ETH appears poised for the resurgence of either long or short positions, potentially initiating a fresh and decisive market movement in either direction.',\n",

       "  'description': \"DOGE has fallen by 1% in the past 24 hours, with the Dogecoin price dropping to $0.1605 on a day when the crypto market as a whole has gained by 1%.Today’s dip means that Dogecoin is down by 2.5% in a week and by 22% in the past fortnight, although the coin has fared better than many others in recent weeks, having overtaken Toncoin (TON) in terms of market cap.And with DOGE still sitting on a 100% gain in a year, it remains in a good position for additional rallies in the coming months.Such rallies could come sooner rather than later, with the post-Bitcoin halving lull likely to give way to more positivity as the market receives improved macroeconomic news.Dogecoin Price Prediction as DOGE Overtakes Toncoin in Coin Rankings – Can DOGE Spike Up to $1? DOGE’s indicators find themselves at what looks like a crossroads, with the meme coin equally capable of further gains or further losses.Most notably, DOGE’s 30-day average (orange) dipped below its 200-day average (blue) yesterday, but it has now recovered slightly and could be about to climb over the longer term average.Source: TradingViewThis could be a sign of an incoming breakout, with the coin’s relative strength index (purple) also point up again after falling close to 50 earlier this morning.Such positions are pretty ambiguous, but it’s interesting to note that DOGE’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other.This may signal an eventual big move, and given that DOGE (and the rest of the market) has been somewhat subdued in recent weeks, it’s entirely arguable that we should go up soon.Indeed, DOGE’s 24-hour trading volume has declined consistently in the past week or so, again implying that a bounce should arrive soon.It’s also worth pointing out that the most recent data suggests that some whales had been accumulating DOGE during its recent downturn, preparing themselves for the next rally.🚨 150,000,000 (23,552,001 USD) transferred from to unknown wallet— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) Of course, it’s hard to say when the next significant rally will arrive, with the wider market being in something of a semi-funk following the Bitcoin halving last week.Yet given that , we may see things become more bullish in the next few months.And the Dogecoin price itself may benefit from more championing by Elon Musk, and perhaps from the rollout of digital payments on X.It could reach $0.25 by summer, and potentially end the year at $0.4.Newer Meme Tokens For Market-Beating Gains DOGE is likely to see further notable rallies this year, yet its progress may be piecemeal and relatively modest, at least compared to previous cycles.For this reason, traders seeking bigger, above-average gains may prefer to take a chance on newer meme coins, especially tokens which are holding presales and getting ready to list.One of the best examples of this is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based coin that has raised over $10 million in its hugely popular presale.🚀🌕 Prepare for a moonshot as we ready the engines of the Slothship! 🌿🦥 With the launch just around the corner, our slothful crew is gearing up for an epic journey through the crypto cosmos.

       "  'description': 'Finland’s Tax authority has found profits from sales of unreported crypto gains in 2023, amounting to €30 Million ($31.9 million). As a result, the EU nation has mandated reporting of income from the sale of mining digital assets.Per a , in line with the tax supervision following the unreported tax gains last year, the authority has asked those who invested in virtual currencies to pay ten million euros in capital income tax.“The amount found last year is large in euro terms, which indicates that the control works and is effective,” says Mika Siivonen, tax expert from the Finnish Tax Administration.Besides paying taxes, individuals who have not declared their income are mandated to pay a tax increase and late penalties. Failing to this may lead to criminal sanctions, the report added.According to the findings from the country’s tax authority, a total of 9,800 customers reported receiving crypto income in 2022. This is lower than that of 2021, which reported 16,000 customers.“When the exchange rates of virtual currencies have been low, investors have sold less of their holdings than before or for some reason sales losses have not been declared for taxation.”Crypto Income Receivers in Finland Still Fail to Declare Tax Siivonen added that they have been receiving more information from crypto exchanges regarding the crypto transactions of Finnish customers.Per the estimates, still a large portion of crypto income receivers fail to declare their income in question for taxation. The Tax Administration received the information from several foreign virtual currency exchanges through international data exchange.“If you received income from the use or mining of virtual currencies in 2023, you must declare the income with a pre-filled tax return,” the report read.Further, the income from cryptos is taxed as capital income, and cryptos received from mining is taxed as earned income.

This tech currently demands significant computational resources, restricting wallet support to computers rather than mobile devices. As for the timeline on mobile wallet availability, it largely depends on the progression of lighter zk-SNARK protocols.Despite ZCash\\'s advanced privacy features, the uptake for private transactions is low; about 95% of transactions are conducted publicly. The reasons range from the lack of understanding of privacy benefits to the comfort of sticking with familiar, less private transaction methods. Incentivizing privacy transactions could encourage users to switch, but privacy is often its own reward for those who value it.Ordinary traders might opt for privacy-enhanced transactions in scenarios where they require confidentiality for security reasons, during high-value transactions or when trading in politically unstable regions.To support privacy transactions, ZCash may need to market the advantages of privacy and create various incentives for private transactions to promote their usage. Buterin\\'s remarks and their potential implementation may in fact drastically change the situation on the private cryptocurrencies market.ZCash stands at the frontier of this debate, holding the flag for privacy with the potential to lead a shift toward more secure and discreet online transactions.

He wrote in an April 22 X post:“EigenLayer has >$15B in TVL but AVSs will actually need less than *10%* of that for security, which means yields may fall off a cliff.”EigenLayer removed the limits on all liquid staking tokens (LSTs) on April 16, according to an X announcement. EigenLayer launched on mainnet on April 10.When a user stakes an LST via EigenLayer, it is automatically delegated to a node operator, which uses the deposits to secure an AVS on EigenLayer while receiving staking rewards. Part of the staking rewards are passed on to the user.  for security, which could lead to issues in the future, according to Chudnov:Yet Actively Validated Services on the protocol require much less staked Ether “The problem is that none of the AVSs will come close to needing $1.5B in security let alone $15B. The whole point of Proof-of-Stake is that the value of the stake is higher than the potential profit earned from a validator behaving dishonestly.”Cointelegraph has approached EigenLayer for comment.EigenLayer is the second-largest protocol on Ethereum after liquid staking protocol Lido. EigenLayer’s TVL rose over 16% during the past month to the current $14.15 billion, according to DefiLlama. The issue could worsen as altcoin prices decline since AVSs won’t be incentivized to hold the excess on-chain capital. The first solution could be a series of token launches to increase the security budget requirements, which could temporarily be “kicking the can down the road.”However, intertwining EigenLayer into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and creating more utility for LSTs could offer a permanent fix. According to Chudnov:“If [the EigenLayer] ecosystem can more deeply entrench itself in the DeFi ecosystem via [Liquid restaking tokens] and financial primitives on top then this is a much more guardable moat and gives AVS’s more time to figure things out at a fraction of the cost.”CointelegraphSolana: Expectation Versus Reality.

       "  'title': 'Justin Sun gearing up for Ether ETF? Data shows $405M ETH bought',\n",
       "  'description': 'In the ongoing struggle within the cryptocurrency landscape, speculation arises regarding a significant purchase made by TRON founder and HTX advisor, Justin Sun. On April 22, 2024, an on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain shared a post on X (previously Twitter), stating, “Did Justin Sun buy 127,288 ETH worth $405.19 million since April 8, 2024?” They also shared multiple reports concerning Sun’s suspected wallet and its purchases during these dates.Did Justin Sun make a big Ethereum purchase?However, this speculation of massive Ethereum purchases coincides with a period when the overall cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn due to the release of United States CPI data and the conflict between Iran and Israel.Upon closer examination of the Lookonchain report, it reveals that the wallet suspected to belong to Justin Sun deposited $787 million of USDT to Binance on Tron since March 31, 2024. Additionally, on the same day, a mysterious wallet was created on Ethereum and withdrew a massive $96.8 million stablecoin from Binance.Subsequently, this same mysterious wallet began purchasing Ethereum from Binance and DEX (Decentralized Exchange), acquiring a total of 127,388 Ethereum worth $405.19 million, with an average price of $3,172. Furthermore, another suspected Justin Sun wallet bought nearly 168,369 Ethereum worth $487 million at an average price of $2,894 from Binance and DEX between February 12 and February 24, 2024.However, the transaction behavior of these two wallets appears relatively similar to each other, suggesting that both may be owned by Justin Sun. If this holds true, it implies that Sun has acquired a total of 295,757 Ethereum worth $891 million from Binance and other DEX since February 12, 2024.Ethereum price performance analysis In addition to these speculations surrounding Justin Sun’s ETH purchase, on April 17, 2024, Todayq News reported that Sun withdrew a massive $196 million USDT from HTX and deposited it to Binance. All these developments strongly support the notion that Sun has indeed purchased this substantial amount of Ethereum from Binance and other DEX, capitalizing on the recent market downturn.Currently, Ethereum is trading near the $3,200 level, and in the last 24 hours, it has experienced a modest 1% upside momentum. Over a longer period, Ethereum’s performance has remained stable in the last 7 days, while in the last 30 days, its price has declined by 9% due to the CPI data and the Iran-Israel conflict. © Todayq News',\n",

       "  'description': 'A group of Bitcoin enthusiasts based in Switzerland is making a renewed effort to convince the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to include Bitcoin in its reserves.\\xa0Their plan involves launching a petition to initiate a referendum that would seek to amend the country’s constitution, which will require gathering over 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens.Yves Bennaïm, the founder and chairman of 2B4CH, a non-profit think tank leading the campaign, believes that adding Bitcoin to the SNB’s reserves would safeguard Switzerland’s “sovereignty and neutrality” in an increasingly uncertain global landscape, he told\\xa0.2B4CH Finalizing Preparations for the Necessary Documents Bennaïm said that they are finalizing the organizational preparations for the committee and the necessary documents to be submitted to the State Chancellery.However, the process is not without its challenges.\\xa0The Swiss constitution stipulates that a referendum can only be held if at least 100,000 Swiss citizens sign a petition within 18 months.\\xa0This requirement posed difficulties for 2B4CH during their first attempt in October 2021.\\xa0At that time, they launched the “Bitcoin Initiative” with the goal of amending Article 99-3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to include Bitcoin as a reserve currency.With a population of 8.77 million in Switzerland, approximately 1.15% of the locals need to support the petition by signing it.\\xa0Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin-focused trading platform Bitcoin Suisse, who is assisting Bennaïm in this initiative, believes that including Bitcoin in the SNB’s reserves would signify Switzerland’s independence from the European Central Bank and enhance its neutrality.Meisser to Discuss Benefits of Adding Bitcoin to Balance Sheet Meisser will have an opportunity to present the benefits of adding Bitcoin to the SNB’s balance sheet during a meeting scheduled for April 26.\\xa0However, he will only have three minutes to make his case.\\xa0In the past, Meisser attempted to persuade the central bank to allocate 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) each month to Bitcoin as an alternative to German government bonds in March 2022.\\xa0Unfortunately, SNB Chair Thomas Jordan reportedly stated in April 2022 that Bitcoin did not meet the requirements to be considered a reserve currency.Meisser argues that Switzerland would currently be 30 billion Swiss francs ($32.9 billion) richer if the central bank had followed his suggestion in 2022.\\xa0He also warns that delaying the move could result in other central banks acquiring Bitcoin at significantly higher prices, leaving Switzerland at a disadvantage.The NZZ article discussing the petition has garnered support from Joana Cotar, a German politician and Bitcoin activist who strongly opposes a European Union-backed digital currency.\\xa0Hahaha.

       "  'description': 'The Chinese Embassy in Angola has reminded its nationals on Angola’s recent prohibition of all crypto mining activities. The authority issued firm warning, emphasizing severe penalties to those who violate the law.The Angolan parliament passed a bill early this year on the “Prohibition of Cryptocurrency and Other Virtual Asset Mining,” which became effective on April 10. Under this law, any form of crypto mining is termed as a ‘criminal’ offence.As for the legal consequences, possession of information or any crypto mining-related equipment will lead to 1-5 years in jail. Additionally, the , read that the government would confiscate the equipment used for mining purposes.“Mining cryptocurrencies by yourself or through others Currency and other virtual assets, or connecting such mining equipment to the national power system, will be sentenced to 3 to 12 years in prison,” it warned.Violators that utilize power facility license to engage in crypto mining activities, will face 3 to 8 years in prison.China Crypto Miners Shift to Africa The warning comes at a time when China’s blanket ban on crypto mining, implemented in 2018, followed a mass exodus of miners to various African nations. This is mainly due to the drastic decrease in the electricity price per unit.Angola, for instance, decreased electricity prices to $17.1 per megawatt hour in 2020. This was the lowest level during the period observed. Overall, prices for electrical energy have been decreasing in the country, according to Statista.As a result, the African nation has become a hotbed for crypto miners, particularly blackballed from nations like China.“Since last year, several Chinese citizens in Angolan have been held legally responsible for engaging in virtual “mining” and suspected of illegal use of electricity,” the Embassy noted.The warning also stressed key hazards of crypto mining, which could easily disrupt economic and financial order. It would also breed illegal and criminal activities, such as fraud, money laundering, pyramid schemes, etc.The Embassy has specifically reminded Chinese citizens and institutions in Angola to strictly abide by the local rules. It cautioned them to use electricity in-accordance with the law, which does not engage in mining activities.',\n",

       "  'description': 'BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) iShares Bitcoin Trust trading under the ticker “IBIT” has seen inflows 69 days straight, said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in a social media post.The fourth Bitcoin halving took place late on Friday at block height 840,000. This marked a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics. The halving event occurs approximately every four years and has reduced the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins.Waking up on 4/20 to see took in cash for the 69th straight day, which was also the halving. It’s a little too perfect — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) The Bitcoin halving has in turn triggered a supply squeeze. Reductions are part of a predefined strategy to limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, enhancing its scarcity by halving the influx of new coins into circulation.The latest from Farside Investments shows that Bitcoin ETF flows are once again gaining momentum after experiencing a slowdown in inflows despite the highly anticipated\\xa0bullish Bitcoin halving event.Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East Impacting Market\\xa0 The growing Israel-Iran conflict has played a role in impacting the Bitcoin price. Last week Bitcoin saw a sell-off and experienced volatility triggered by the military situation in the Middle East. Usually, Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against global uncertainty. On Monday, Bitcoin price remains stable trading at around $66,300.“One financial effect of the conflict in Israel was the strengthening of the Dollar, for instance, measured by the U.S. Dollar Index. This is a move towards safety. Portfolio managers reduce the exposure to high-volatility assets in such a situation. Bitcoin has one of the highest historical volatilities in a portfolio that contains stocks and bonds too. So portfolio managers sell Bitcoin to effectively reduce their portfolio volatility,” Basile Maire, a co-founder of D8X, a decentralized exchange told Cryptonews.\\xa0Macro-Driven BTC Price Largely Driven by Bitcoin ETF TradingMaire went on to explain that we have seen similar Bitcoin price actions earlier this year that coincided with a Dollar strengthening or flight-to-safety. These political events often have a short-lived impact on financial markets.“It looks like macro-driven price impacts on Bitcoin are largely sparked by Bitcoin ETF trading as opposed to crypto-native trading. The introduction of ETFs also seems to strengthen the impact of macro-events on Bitcoin prices,” said Maire.“From the standpoint of portfolio management, it’s understandable that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may experience sharper declines compared to stocks and other traditional assets in this situation,” explains Maire.This doesn’t contradict Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against global uncertainty in the long run.',\n",

That could result in a retest of the $60,775 to $59,600 support zone. Buyers are expected to defend this zone with all their might because a breakdown could accelerate selling. The Contrarily, if the price breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the pair may swing between $60,775 and $73,777 for some more time. The bulls will have to drive the price above the overhead resistance to open the doors for a rally to $84,000.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that the bulls have the edge in the near term. The pair could face resistance between $67,000 and $68,000, but if this zone is cleared, the next stop may be $71,000.This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. That could signal aggressive selling on rallies. The pair may slide to $63,000 and subsequently to $60,775.Binance Coin price analysisBinance Coin (BNB) has been range-bound between $495 and $635 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. pair could move toward the overhead resistance of $635, where the bears are likely to sell aggressively. If the price turns down sharply from $635, the range-bound action may continue for a while longer.Buyers pushed the price above the moving averages on April 20, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $635 or below $495. If the $635 level is taken out, the pair may start its journey toward $692. On the downside, a slide below $495 could sink the pair to $460.The 20-EMA has started to turn up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are attempting a comeback. There is a minor resistance at $585, but if this level is crossed, the pair may reach $600 and then $635. The bears are likely to mount a strong defense near $635.The positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then slump to $540 and later to $510. Near Protocol price analysisNear Protocol (NEAR) has been falling inside a descending channel pattern, indicating that the trend favors the bears. pair will attempt a rally to the resistance line, where the bears are likely to sell aggressively. If the price turns down sharply from the resistance line, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the channel.However, the rise above the 20-day EMA ($6.15) suggests that the selling pressure may be reducing in the short term. The If buyers want to gain the upper hand, they will have to drive the pair above the channel. That will signal a short-term trend change, and the pair may rally to $8 and then to $9.After a long struggle, the pair broke above the $5.90 level, indicating that bulls have a slight edge. The price may turn down and retest $5.90, but if bulls flip this level into support, the pair may reach the resistance line.Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the breakout above $5.90 may have been a bull trap. That could drag the price down to $5 and later to the support line of the channel. Mantle price analysisMantle (MNT) broke out of the 20-day EMA ($1.18) on April 20 after staying between the moving averages for several days. This suggests that bulls are trying to take charge.However, the long wick on the April 21 candlestick shows that the bears have not yet given up and are attempting to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, it may trap the aggressive bulls and yank the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.09). A break below this level could sink the MNT/USDT pair to $1.On the contrary, if the price maintains above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are defending the level. The pair may then rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.32, and if this level is scaled, the next stop could be $1.51.The bulls have pushed the price above the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that the correction may have ended. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will increase the possibility of a rally above $1.25. The pair may then rise to $1.32.Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to tug the price back into the triangle. That may trap the bulls, and a break below the triangle will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair may then tumble to $1.Render price analysisRender (RNDR) has been in a corrective phase for several days, but the bulls are trying to make a comeback by pushing the price above the downtrend line.  pair is likely to rise to the 50-day SMA ($9.95) and then to $12.The 20-day EMA ($8.90) has flattened out, and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip. If the price maintains above the 20-day EMA, the Instead, if the price turns down and sustains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a fake move. The bears will then try to pull the price to $7 and later to $6.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, indicating advantage to buyers. However, the bears may pose a strong challenge at $9.50. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance but takes support at the 20-EMA, it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a rally to $10.50.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the moving averages will suggest that the recent breakout was a bull trap. The pair may then descend to $7.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

       "  'description': 'Investors are accumulating Ethereum in droves amidst what could become a return to bullish sentiment for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum is currently ranging around $3,170, with its price undergoing volatility in the past seven days. Amidst this price volatility, on-chain data has revealed an accumulation trend from Ether investors during the week. Additionally, transaction data has shown an uptick in whale movement of ETH to and from exchanges, with recent market happenings indicating a transformation in the price of the crypto asset.Ethereum Sees Major Accumulation As Investors Stock UpEthereum is now at a fundamental junction which could see its price surging in the new week and beyond. This fundamental catalyst for a price surge has come through the recent entry of Spot Ether ETFs into the Asian market. Regulators in Hong Kong have greenlit the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs along with Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country, prompting investors to make strategic ETH movements in light of an incoming price surge.\\xa0Particularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a strategic accumulation pattern from ETH investors, with over $500 million worth of ETH leaving centralized exchanges in the past week. Interestingly, this surge in movement is the highest single-week outflow from exchanges recorded on the Ethereum network since February.\\xa0 was withdrawn from CEXs this week, the highest since February Half a billion When investors withdraw crypto from exchanges, it usually means they’re looking to hold it for the long term.

       "  'title': ' What are Ether futures ETFs, and how do they work? ',\n",
       "  'description': ' Ether futures ETFs, explained  Ether futures ETFs are investment funds that track Ethereum futures contracts, not Ethereum itself. futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), providing a regulated method of investing in Ethereum using a brokerage account.Consider a contract that commits to purchasing Ethereum at a specific price at a future time. These derivative contracts are traded via Ether In 2021, the first Ether futures ETFs were introduced in Canada. Although futures-based ETFs have been approved, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet approved a spot Ether ETF in the country.Asset management companies oversee Ether futures ETFs. The major issuers offering Ether futures ETFs are Bitwise, VanEck and ProShares. These firms take care of the complexities involved in purchasing and disposing of futures contracts, controlling rollovers to preserve exposure and ensuring the ETF complies with legal requirements.   How Ether futures ETFs work  Without actually holding the cryptocurrency, investors can speculate on Ethereum’s future price using Ether futures ETFs.\\xa0Rather than retaining tangible assets, Ether futures ETFs make investments in futures contracts. These contracts are commitments to buy or sell ether on a predetermined future date for a predetermined price. Without having to deal with wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges, investors can be exposed to Ethereum’s price fluctuations by purchasing these contracts through the ETF, which simply pools investors’ money to acquire them.Assume an Ether futures ETF has a contract to purchase 100 ETH at a price of $4,000 each in three months. The ETF gains profit, and its share price rises if Ether reaches $4,500 by the contract’s expiration date. In contrast, the ETF experiences a loss if ETH’s price falls to $3,500.A crucial point to remember is that Ether futures ETFs continuously manage their contracts by rolling them over to preserve exposure. This means they purchase new contracts with later expiration dates and sell the ones that are about to expire. The price of the ETF and the real spot price of Ether may differ slightly as a result of this process.   How to invest in Ether futures ETFs  To invest in an Ether futures ETF, select a brokerage, find the desired ETF, such as the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, research it thoroughly and place an order to complete the purchase.Here are the general steps involved in investing in Ether futures ETFs, using the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF as an example. The VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF offers regulated exposure to Ether futures, streamlining direct ownership complexities, and its C-Corporation (C-Corp) structure enhances tax efficiency for investors.Select a brokerageThe first step involves creating an account on a brokerage platform (e.g., Fidelity, Robinhood, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab) that allows trading of ETFs.\\xa0Find the ETFUse its ticker symbol to look for the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF or any other Ether futures ETF. The VanEck ETF’s ticker symbol is EFUT.Research about the ETFConduct due diligence on the chosen ETF before purchasing. Read the fact sheet and prospectus, as well as the holdings, fees and risks related to futures contracts.Place an orderBuy the desired number of shares of the Ether futures ETF by placing a buy order, just like you would with traditional stock. To complete the purchase, specify your order type, such as a limit or market order.Keep an eye on your investmentFollowing purchase, monitor the ETF’s performance; remember that Ether futures ETFs carry the inherited cryptocurrency volatility that may reflect in their share price.   Why a C-Corp may mean tax benefits for Ether futures ETF investors?  C-Corp structured Ether futures ETFs may offer significant tax benefits to long-term investors compared to traditional regulated investment companies (RICs).Traditional corporations, or C-corps, are liable to both corporate and shareholder dividend double taxation. They allow for the distribution of profits to be flexible and offset future gains with losses. In contrast, RICs are special investment companies that must distribute the majority of their profits to shareholders but are subject to pass-through taxation, avoiding company-level tax.The capacity of C-Corps like VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF to carry forward losses to balance off future gains may help investors pay less in taxes. Additionally, more money may stay invested and compound over time because they are also not required to distribute capital gains to investors.\\xa0Moreover, an investor’s after-tax returns can be further increased because payouts from a C-Corp Ether futures ETF are frequently taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate as opposed to regular income rates.   Advantages of Ether futures ETFs  Ether futures ETFs offer a convenient way to trade Ethereum without needing cryptocurrency wallets, providing regulatory protection and potential tax benefits while also serving as a hedge against traditional assets and allowing speculation on market downturns.Just like regular stocks, Ether futures ETFs can be bought and sold through traditional brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to configure cryptocurrency wallets and use exchanges.By operating within pre-existing regulatory frameworks, Ether futures ETFs provide investors with a degree of protection and oversight that may not be as robust as in direct cryptocurrency markets.Moreover, by introducing cryptocurrency exposure into a diversified portfolio, these ETFs may act as a hedge against conventional assets and provide investors access to the Ethereum ecosystem’s development potential.As opposed to actually owning ETH, Ether futures ETFs may provide considerable tax benefits in some jurisdictions. Gains and losses may be treated differently, potentially reducing investors’ tax burden. Additionally, investors can speculate on a drop in the price of Ethereum with futures-based ETFs. This offers chances to profit from market downturns or protect other investments in a portfolio.   Risks associated with Ether futures ETFs  Investing in Ether futures ETFs entails risks due to price discrepancies with ETH, exacerbated by its volatility and complexity, along with management fees and potential liquidity issues.The price of Ether futures ETFs may not always coincide with the spot price of Ethereum because they monitor futures contracts. Furthermore, contango — a scenario in which futures prices exceed the spot price — may occur. Because it continuously rolls over contracts, this can gradually reduce the ETF’s returns.ETH is highly volatile, just like other cryptocurrencies. Ether futures ETFs are more risky investments since they inherit this volatility from actual Ethereum. Additionally, some investors would find it hard to understand and invest in these financial instruments due to the high level of complexity involved.Furthermore, Ether futures ETFs charge management fees, which add to overall investment cost like any ETF. These fees can eat into potential returns. In addition, certain Ether futures ETFs may have lower trading volumes than Bitcoin futures ETFs, making it difficult to buy or sell shares at desired prices, especially in large quantities. ',\n",

       "  'description': \" price is up today, rising 4.25% to reach approximately $3,200 on April 21. The cryptocurrency's gains mirror upside moves elsewhere in the crypto market, with the latter's total market capitalization rising 3.5% in the same period.Ether Let's review the main reasons behind Ether's outperformance versus the broader crypto market today.Capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ether market market.Today's gains in Ether versus the U.S. dollar are largely driven by capital inflows in the Bitcoin Notably, the ETH/BTC pair is up roughly 2.5% in the last 24 hours to reach 0.048 BTC on April 21. Consequently, the Ethereum Dominance Index (ETH.D), which tracks Ether's market strength versus the rest of the crypto market, grew by over 1% in the same period.These gains are part of a rebound that began on April 19, coinciding with Bitcoin's fourth halving. Since that pivotal event, the ETH/BTC ratio and ETH Dominance (ETH.D) have increased by approximately 3% and 0.75%, respectively. Historically, the Ethereum market has often seen increased capital inflows from the Bitcoin market shortly after each Bitcoin halving event. For example, following the second halving in July 2016, the ETH/BTC pair surged by as much as 64%.\\xa0Similarly, after the third halving in May 2020, this pair saw an increase of nearly 100%.This pattern suggests that investors tend to either sell their BTC holdings or reduce their demand for Bitcoin once the halving occurs, as the anticipated price increase leading up to the event is usually already factored into the market. Consequently, alternative cryptocurrencies like Ether benefit from this shift in investor focus, as capital diverted from Bitcoin seeks new opportunities for growth in other parts of the crypto market.\\xa0Return of Ethereum whalesEther’s latest gains precede a period of accumulation among its richest investors, also known as whales.According to data resource Glassnode, the Ether supply held by addresses with a balance between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have increased in the past two weeks.Similarly, the Ethereum supply held by entities with a 10,000-100,000 ETH balance has also rebounded recently, indicating the return of whales to the Ether market.Interestingly, this accumulation pattern has often been a precursor to significant price upside, such as the one Ether is witnessing today.Technical ETH price reboundEther's gains today appear further after testing the lower trendline of its prevailing descending channel\\xa0pattern as support. Interestingly, this support level is also near ETH's 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line at around $2,820 and its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) at around $2,725, showing traders see the support area as a good zone to buy Ether. For instance,\\xa0the trendline support aligns closely with ETH's 0.5 Fibonacci retracement line at around $2,820 and the 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) at approximately $2,725.These converging indicators suggest traders view this support zone as an attractive point to purchase Ether.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

       "  'description': \"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin reminded us that crypto is not about trading digital assets, it is about liberty and decentralization. His statement raises crucial questions about the role of cryptocurrencies in fostering freedom and privacy in the face of global surveillance concerns.Buterin's assertion underlines a disconcerting trend where individual rights can potentially be compromised by expansive surveillance measures. The fear that governmental powers could misuse such capabilities to monitor adversaries or the public is not unfounded. The ethos of crypto was birthed as a countermeasure to such centralizations of power, aiming to distribute control back to individuals.However, the cryptocurrency landscape, including Ethereum, faces its paradoxes. Despite the decentralized ideals, a significant portion of Ethereum's transactions have encountered censorship, most notably with compliance to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This contradiction raised a lot of noise in the cryptocurrency community and even became a topic of existential discussion within the Ethereum community.Moreover, Ethereum's shift from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in its consensus mechanism has been touted as a step toward greater efficiency and environmental sustainability. Nonetheless, PoS does not necessarily lead to more decentralization. In PoS, those with larger stakes — or more tokens — have more influence, potentially leading to concentration of power, which is at odds with the fundamental crypto principle of equalizing power distribution, despite the same issue existing in the PoW environment.Ethereum's value has seen considerable volatility after the most recent market-wide correction. Recent trends show resilience after the return above $3,000, but the second-biggest cryptocurrency is yet to show its true potential as the post-halving rally is expected to push the value of ETH at least toward its previous ATH at approximately $5,000.\",\n",

While the halving aims to increase scarcity and potentially boost prices, the immediate market reaction has been subdued, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $64,000.\\xa0Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze Shakes Up the Market The fourth Bitcoin halving took place late Friday at block height 840,000, marking a pivotal change in the cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics.

This pivotal event, which occurs roughly every four years, drastically impacts the economic viability of mining activities.Leading up to the halving, anticipation fueled a rise in the stock prices of major Bitcoin mining firms, reflecting investor speculation about which companies would adapt best to the new reward structure.Notable firms like Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw their stock prices increase by over 10%, with similar gains observed in other prominent companies such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Clean Spark (CLSK).Operational adjustments: Mining companies are compelled to refine their strategies, often by expanding operations to mitigate the impact of reduced rewards.Impact on stock prices: Mining firms on the Nasdaq experienced substantial stock price increases due to pre-halving speculation.Bitcoin in half, directly affecting profitability.Post-halving, mining operations must enhance their efficiency and possibly seek additional capital to stay competitive.Historical trends suggest that although total miner revenue typically drops shortly after a halving, it tends to recover over the year as Bitcoin’s price potentially increases and larger mining operations expand.

       "  'description': 'The digital assets industry marked another historic day in its success story as the world’s most popular crypto experienced its fourth halving event. This episode is crucial for Bitcoin as it halves the incentives rewarded to miners with an aim to slow down the new coins entering the supply chain. However, it has further implications for investors, miners, and the industry.Bitcoin halving hypeAs expected the halving event will likely have an immediate impact on miners. This community is liable for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. The block reward is reduced from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. This signals that miners will face lowered rewards for their efforts.\\xa0Data shows that the current minimum transaction fee on the Bitcoin network exceeds 1,050 sat/vb (approx worth $94). It added that there are more than 237,000 transactions pending confirmation, and the memory usage exceeds 300 MB and reaches 1.15 GB. It mentioned that runes went online and new runes were minted, which caused congestion.IntoTheBlock reported that before the halving happened, miners’ Bitcoin holdings hit 12 year low. This shows that miners have been net sellers leading up to the halving.As of now, Bitcoin fees have exploded drastically with Ordinals NFTs and meme coins like PUPS recording high volumes.Bitcoin price haven’t seen the anticipated hike till now. BTC price is down by 2% in the last 24 hours, while it has dropped by over 5% over the last 7 days. The original crypto is trading at an average price of $63,700, at the press time. It is down by around 13% from its all time high (ATH) of $73,750 recorded on March 14.BTC’s 24 hour trading volume is down by 36% to stand at $32.4 billion. Its market cap stands at around $1.25 trillion.What’s next?Experts hint that miners with access to affordable and reliable power sources are better positioned to navigate the post-halving market. Meanwhile, there are still some miners with limited access to power and efficient machines. They may have to exit the market which can lead to limited access to power and efficient machines.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank had already given out their prediction post halving. They anticipate a potential downside in bitcoin’s price after the halving. However, the demand shock from these ETFs could offset any negative price movements.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum Poised to Retest $3.5K as Bullish Sign Reappear (ETH Price Analysis)',\n",
       "  'description': 'After experiencing a rapid downturn, Ethereum has found itself supported by a substantial zone, comprising the 100-day moving average and a critical price range between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels. Consequently, a bullish rebound is anticipated in the medium term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart A thorough examination of the daily chart reveals an extended period of corrective retracements, culminating in the price finding support within a pivotal zone.This zone encompasses the 100-day moving average at $3050 and the significant price range between the 0.5 ($3190) and 0.618 ($2972) Fibonacci levels.This range carries significance as it attracts considerable demand, potentially hindering further downward pressure from market sellers. Additionally, a minor bullish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a bullish resurgence, targeting a reclaim of the $3.5K threshold. However, despite the bullish indications, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect toward the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.The 4-Hour Chart A closer inspection of the 4-hour chart reveals the formation of a descending wedge pattern during a multi-month consolidation correction. Following a significant decline, the price has reached the lower boundary of the wedge and the support region around $3K.Nonetheless, given the potential buying pressure within this crucial range, the price has entered a consolidation phase characterized by minimal volatility.This price action highlights a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the 4-hour timeframe suggests the strength of buyers, increasing the likelihood of a bullish upswing in the medium term. In such a scenario, the next target for the price would be the critical resistance level at $3.5K. Conversely, should a break below this support occur, a descent toward the $2.7K support becomes increasingly probable.Sentiment Analysis By ShayanAs Ethereum’s price exhibits signs of recovery, it’s crucial to determine whether this resurgence stems from spot buying or leveraged futures activity. A key metric for this analysis is the funding rates, where positive values signify bullish sentiment and negative values indicate fear in the market.Observing the recent downtrend in Ethereum’s price, it’s notable that the funding rate metric has mirrored this trajectory, steadily declining until reaching near-zero levels. This alignment suggests that the recent price drop has led to the liquidation of a significant number of positions in the perpetual market, resulting in a cooling effect on the futures market. Consequently, the market appears primed for the re-emergence of long positions, with the potential for a fresh upward surge.',\n",

       "  'description': 'A member of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who is emphatically critical of Bitcoin and crypto may lose her spot at the agency’s high table on June 5, government records suggest., Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw was sworn into her position alongside Commissioner Hester M. Peirce (aka “Crypto Mom”) on August 17, 2020. Both have terms that are due to expire on June 5 – less than 50 days from today.SEC Commissioner Approaches End Of Term According to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret, recent White House statements and nominations show no signs that Crenshaw or anyone else has been nominated to fill her position after her term is finished.🚨NEW: l got lots of messages yesterday asking if the resignation rumor was true. Firstly, it’s an election year and there’s a high possibility these could be his final few months as chairman, a position he likes, so it’s unlikely he would throw in the towel early.… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) “The White House had no comment on the matter,” Terret said.The revelation follows rumors earlier this week that SEC chairman Gary Gensler may soon resign after on Tuesday that read somewhat like a goodbye message.Several crypto-supportive congressmen, including Tom Emmer, have called on Gensler to resign for his hostile treatment of the industry and failure to adequately protect investors from its true bad actors.Under his leadership, the agency has filed dozens of enforcement actions against top crypto firms accusing them of securities law violations, while their leaders say the regulator’s evaluation of the law with respect to crypto is both unclear and outdated.Terret believes the likelihood of Gensler actually resigning during an election year is slim to none, and the odds of finding a nominee to replace him are “virtually impossible.”Crenshaw’s Views On Bitcoin Crenshaw’s potential exit could be more important for the industry. Unlike Gensler, she voted not to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs for U.S. markets in January even though the agency had already lost a court case on the matter months prior.“These Commission actions are unsound and ahistorical,” Crenshaw wrote in a dissenting letter at the time. “And worse, they put us on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.”The commissioner added that spot Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated and said the crypto spot markets are a “petri dish” of fraudulent conduct.“If the technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?” she added.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggested the probability of an upward price trajectory for Bitcoin on April 18, citing recurring patterns in its market behavior. His analysis showed that Bitcoin prices tend to follow a repeating pattern, suggesting a bullish trajectory.Peter Brandt Bitcoin Price Prediction Entails Three Phases The seasoned trader analyzed Bitcoin’s market behavior , where he classified the asset into three phases: Hump-Slump, Bump-Rump, and Pump-Dump.Peter Brandt’s chart on recurring BTC price patterns connected three phases of Bitcoin.According to the chart presented by Brandt, the current Bitcoin market has completed the first and second phases and is in the third phase.He noted that the “dump” part of the third stage had taken place while the “pump” phase was yet to materialize, suggesting a forthcoming BTC price increase.His deduction of a potential major Bitcoin price move comes amid a bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, largely due to the news of the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran.Brandt’s analysis offers a potentially deeper perspective on the recent trajectory of BTC’s price, however.For instance, when Israel launched a retaliatory attack on Iran overnight, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $59K from its prior price of $63.4K before recovering to $65K. This rapid shift in trend has also fueled gains in other cryptocurrencies, indicating the possibility of an altcoin rally.BTC price dipped to $59K in the early hours of April 19. Source: CoinmarketCap.Meanwhile, that large Bitcoin holders (crypto whales) may have used the price dip to accumulate more cryptocurrencies at a discount.Earlier this week, Cryptonews.com reported a transfer of over 27.7K BTC ($1.75 billion) sent into accumulation wallet addresses between April 16 and April 17. This exceeded the previous record of 25,500 BTC (almost $1.6 billion) sent to such wallets on March 23, when the Bitcoin price was around $63.5K.Additionally, the impending Bitcoin halving event strengthens Brandt’s Bitcoin price prediction. The halving is designed to reduce incentives for mining new blocks, thereby slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created.JUST IN: 100 blocks remain until halving. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) Bitcoin halving has a history of driving up the demand and price of BTC.Peter Brandt’s “Pump” Phase May Kickoff Soon Peter Brandt’s optimism for a BTC price increase aligns with market analysis insights from other experts as well, including pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital.The trader claimed that the current dip period of BTC, which is dubbed as the third or “Dump” stage in Brandt’s projection, might be the last opportunity for Bitcoin holders to purchase BTC at a relatively low value before post-halving sets in.In a post on X, that recent BTC price movement features are similar to previous Bitcoin halving cycles, during which price declines gave way to rallies.3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving1. Final Pre-Halving RetraceBitcoin has produced two -18% retraces prior to the Halving in the span of just over a monthIn mid-March, BTC pulled back -18% before recovering to $70000 and now in mid-April BTC has retraced -18% againThis… — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) Rekt projected a “re-accumulation phase” for Bitcoin following the halving event scheduled for April 20, adding that this phase has a history of lasting over a year (385 days).A Reck Capital chart suggests incoming price growth for BTC.Due to current market conditions, however, Rekt Capital suggested that this phase could be shorter, leading to a potential BTC price increase sooner compared to previous cycles.',\n",

Hodgkins, Blockdaemon’s Senior Manager of Growth Strategy, sat down with Cointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra to discuss the current state of the industry as well as what to expect going forward.As to the current state of the industry, Hodgkins says there’s still room for growth: “I would probably say that institutional adoption in the space is at its highest point it's ever been, but I wouldn't mistake that with saying that there's loads of institutional adoption.”He expanded, adding that there was work yet to be done, “It's the highest it's ever been and as a result there's a lot of reason to be bullish around what's happening.”Hodgkins cited the launch of the first Bitcoin spot ETFs in January and their ensuing adoption rates as bullish indicators. But there appears to be plenty of runway left for adoption:“When it comes to wide scale adoption in institutions across the spectrum of institutions, from asset managers to pension funds, to hedge funds, to sovereign wealth funds, I think we're still very much at the foot of the hill.”Blockdaemon, and by extension its growth manager, Hodgkins, are well positioned to garner a bird’s eye view of the blockchain industry. The company, according to Hodgkins, is “the world's leading Blockchain infrastructure provider.” Its services span “the entire spectrum of infrastructure needs from dedicated node access, API access ability, to run validators and staking rewards, all the way through to MPC wallet technology.”Hodgkins says the next few cycles could produce even more industry-changing events. “What we might see in the near future is, potentially, an Ethereum ETF,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that the myriad use cases for blockchain and cryptocurrency technology could lead to mass adoption by industries such as the automotive and transportation sectors.

       "  'description': \"As Bitcoin (BTC) hovers just above the $64,000 level with the issuance rate halving just hours away and most other major altcoins trade with little by way of impetus, traders are turning to on-chain crypto market monitoring tools like DEXScreener as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.On-chain markets refer to crypto assets issued and traded directly on the blockchain.Ethereum, Solana, and BNB are the most commonly used chains by those issuing or trading on-chain tokens.These on-chain markets are highly illiquid compared to centralized spot cryptocurrency exchanges or traditional financial markets.The Halving is Coming. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) That makes them highly volatile. A newly launched coin can easily see gains of 100x in days as its market cap surges from the tens of thousands to millions.Equally, a small amount of sell pressure can trigger huge price drops. And that’s not the only risk.There is virtually no barrier to entry for someone to issue their own token. That means scammers flock to the on-chain crypto markets to attempt to scam unaware investors.They can do this by inserting malicious code into the token’s smart contract creating unfair trading conditions.Alternatively, the token might be a pump-and-dump scheme. This is where the team behind a token builds up artificial hype to create demand, cashes in, and abandons ship.One popular technique is for a token’s issuer to watch the ETH in the token’s liquidity pool rise as the token’s price pumps, only to withdraw and make off with this ETH abruptly.That’s why many on-chain investors look for “locked liquidity,” which prevents such rug pull attempts.All that being said, let’s take a look at some of the top crypto gainers today in the on-chain markets.Top Crypto Gainers TodayRunesBot (RBOT)The newly launched Ethereum token in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener.RunesBot is a telegram trading bot built to function on the soon-to-be-launched Runes ecosystem.The token’s market cap was last around $1.8 million, with just over $200,000 in locked liquidity.While it looks like a legitimate project, RBOT has a few aspects that are concerning to its smart contract.Transfers are pausable and there is a 5% buy and sell tax.Traders should always exercise caution before involving themselves in the on-chain market.BitRunes (BRUNES)Another Runes protocol-linked token called BitRunes (BRUNES) is pumping hard on Friday.As per DEXScreener, it was last with a market cap of $9.5 million.BitRunes allows users to bridge their Ethereum funds to the Bitcoin network through the Rune Launchpad.The token last had $520,000 in locked liquidity and has seen 24-hour trading volumes of $4.5 million.Like RBOT, it looks like a legitimate project. But like RBOT, its smart contract has concerning aspects.BitRunes has a modifiable tax and transfers are pausable. Additionally, the ownership of the token hasn’t yet been renounced.Alien King (ALK)A Base launched meme coin called Alien King (ALK) has pumped hard since its launch on Friday.As per DEXScreener, in the past 24 hours, with its market cap reaching $1 million.I'm visiting somewhere in the earth. I will send you the secret gift if someone own ALK 👽The King said 👑👑👑 — Alien King (@AlienKi_) The token has locked liquidity of $244,000 and has seen over $13.3 million in volume so far.As per Go+ Security, the token has zero smart contract issues. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a pump and dump. Traders must always be cautious and do their own research.Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.An innocent-looking project could easily be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is\\xa0getting involved in crypto presales.The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.Here are 19 of the presale projects with the highest potential.See the 19 Cryptocurrencies\",\n",

While many remain unfazed by the market dynamics, some sectors of the crypto community have turned more pessimistic, and their bags are seemingly going down instead of up.Despite this, some projects have shown a remarkable performance this week. Among the top gainers today, privacy protocol Railgun has skyrocketed 53% in the last 24 hours after a week of support from crucial figures in the crypto industry.Vitalik Buterin Shows Support To Privacy ToolsOn Monday, news broke that Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin had transferred 100 ETH, worth around $325,000, to Railgun. The project is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) privacy protocol that allows DeFi private transactions.Although the move raised criticism, most replies supported his use of privacy tools. Some users pointed out that Buterin’s every on-chain move is watched and speculated on.Ethereum’s founder later addressed the news, expressing support for the project’s use of the Privacy Pools protocol, which “makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users’ privacy.” ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.Railgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( Privacy is normal.Buterin also stated in his post that “privacy is normal,” an idea he has expressed several times before. He has researched the use of Privacy Pools to achieve an equilibrium between blockchain privacy and regulatory compliance.After the post, Railgun (RAIL) skyrocketed 257%. The token went from trading at $0.56 to changing hands for $1.97 in a few hours. Moreover, the rest of the privacy tokens market saw a pump, with tokens like Monero (XRM) and Oasis Network (ROSE) rising 7% and 12.3%, respectively. As of this writing, privacy tokens are 4.7% up, per CoinGecko data.Railgun Defends From Crypto Laundering AllegationsOn Tuesday, the crypto news platform Wu Blockchain highlighted the alleged links between the privacy protocol and the North Korean hacker group Lazarus Group. The post affirmed that Lazarus Group “is also a user of the coin mixer Railgun.”Moreover, the news platform pointed out that, in January 2023, the US FBI claimed over $60 million worth of stolen ETH was laundered through Railgun. Additionally, the post stated that the privacy protocol became the “main alternative” after the Tornado Cash sanctions.Railgun shut down Wu Blockchain’s claims, deeming them “not true and false reporting.” The post stated the news was “a mistaken, false allegation in the first place.”However, they clarified that the Lazarus Group is blocked from using the protocol’s system due to the “Private Proofs of Innocence” (Private POI).The Private POI tool was implemented a year ago and gives “cryptographic assurance that funds entering the RAILGUN smart contract are not from a known list of transactions or actors considered undesirable by respective wallet providers.” token!  who since yesterday are serving spot markets for Congratulations to the exchange website Despite the controversy, the price of RAIL remained above the $1 support level, hovering between $1.00 and $1.30 in the following days. RAIL continued an upward trajectory after its listing on the crypto exchange Poloniex.At writing time, RAIL is trading at $1.85, an 18.2% surge in the last hour. According to an X user, a whale recently bought 152,034 RAIL tokens, which could have fueled the price jump.Moreover, following its remarkable week, RAIL has increased 156% in the last seven days, with its daily trading volume rising a stellar 376% from yesterday.\",\n",

It will fall from the current 6.25 BTC tokens per block to 3.125 BTC tokens per block.The Halving is Coming. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) This will reduce Bitcoin’s annual inflation rate to around 1%. And, in the long run, the halving will directly reduce spot market sell pressure from miners, who constantly need to sell some of their Bitcoin stash to fund their mining operations.That all sounds very bullish, and in the past, Bitcoin halvings have preceded massive run-ups in the crypto’s price.The 2012 halving was followed by a 93x rally. 2016 was followed by a 30x rally. And 2020 was followed by an 8x rally.But the Bitcoin price had never rallied to fresh record highs ahead of any of these prior halvings. That’s not been the case this time around, with Bitcoin hitting new record levels in March 2024 near $74,000.Some think that the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January brought some of Bitcoin’s expected post-halving rally forward. That suggests that Bitcoin may have less room to run higher this time when compared to the past.Bitcoin (BTC) – The Best Crypto to Buy Now For New Investors But even if Bitcoin was “only” able to post a 3x rally after the halving this time, that would see it reach $180,000.And the post-halving rally may have to wait a few months. Post-halving rallies typically haven’t kicked in for 4-6 months. That could reflect a short-term rise in miner sell pressure as they cope with a sudden drop in revenue.Also, macro headwinds have been building recently. and has forced traders to price out rate cut bets lately.But Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains robust. The halving is great marketing for Bitcoin, reinforcing the narrative that it is “sound money” and akin to digital gold.Moreover, the Fed remains likely to cut interest rates at some point. All the while, spot Bitcoin ETF demand is likely to remain a tailwind. And this year’s US election will probably see a pro-crypto shift in the US regulatory landscape.The odds that Bitcoin hits $100,000 in the coming quarters remains strong.

The pair will try to rise to the overhead resistance of $3,679.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) has been consolidating between $495 and $635 for the past several days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $635. This is an essential level for the bears to defend because a break above it could clear the path for a rally to $692. If this level is crossed, the pair may reach the pattern target of $775.If buyers overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA ($565), the On the other hand, if the price turns down and breaks below $495, the pair will complete a double top pattern. That could start a slide to $460 and thereafter to $400.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) has been finding support at $126 for the past few days, indicating solid buying by the bulls. pair below $126. If they succeed, the pair could extend the downtrend to the psychological level of $100.The recovery is likely to reach the 20-day EMA ($158), a critical level to keep an eye on. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the On the contrary, if the price continues higher and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The $162 level may act as a resistance, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then climb to $185.XRP price analysisXRP (XRP) has been oscillating between $0.46 and $0.52 for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a recovery.  pair could retest the critical support at $0.46.The relief rally is likely to face selling at the downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.55). A sharp reversal from the 20-day EMA will signal that bears remain active at higher levels. The Instead, if the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA, extending its stay inside the $0.41 to $0.74 range for some more time.Dogecoin price analysisThe long tail on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) April 19 candlestick shows that the bulls are trying to protect the $0.14 support. pair could reach the downtrend line, where the bears are likely to sell aggressively.The recovery is likely to reach the 20-day EMA ($0.17), a significant level to watch out for. If buyers overcome this barrier, the The zone between $0.14 and $0.12 is likely to attract strong buying by the bulls because if the support gives way, the pair could face intense selling and tumble toward the formidable support at $0.10. Toncoin price analysisToncoin (TON) rebounded off the support line of the ascending channel pattern on April 18, indicating that the bulls continue to defend the level with vigor. pair may remain inside the channel for several more days.The bulls pushed the price to $7.23 on April 19, but the long wick on the candlestick shows aggressive selling by the bears near the resistance line of the channel. This suggests that the A slide below the channel will signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair may slide to the 50-day SMA ($4.70). On the contrary, a break above the channel could open the doors for a rally to $8.56 and then to $10. Cardano price analysisAlthough Cardano (ADA) traded below the $0.46 support for a few days, the bulls did not allow the price to slip below the April 13 low of $0.40.The failure to sink the price lower may attract buyers who will try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.52). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the rallies are being sold into. That could pull the price to the $0.46 to $0.40 support zone. A slide below the zone could result in a fall to $0.35. pair could then attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.63).Contrarily, if buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The Avalanche price analysisAvalanche (AVAX) is consolidating in a downtrend, indicating that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline. pair could rally to the downtrend line. Buyers will have to clear this obstacle to signal that the correction may be over. The pair may then attempt a rally to $50.The zone between $32 and $27 is likely to act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off the support zone with strength, the Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $27, it will indicate that the bears have seized control. That could accelerate selling and sink the pair to $20. Shiba Inu price analysisShiba Inu (SHIB) has been hovering near $0.000022 for the past few days, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. pair could start the next leg of the down move to $0.000017. This level may act as a strong support, but if the bears prevail, the pair may complete a 100% retracement of the latest leg of the rally and plummet to $0.000010.If the price turns down and skids below $0.000020, the The advantage will tilt in favor of the buyers if the price rises and maintains above the downtrend line. The pair could gradually rise to $0.000033 and after that attempt a rally to $0.000039.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

       "  'description': \"As the Litecoin (LTC) price consolidates at the $80 level, some are asking whether 10x gains, or even a rally to $1,000 might be possible this crypto bull market.Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to record levels near $74,000 last month. At the same time, Litecoin was only able to rally to highs just above $110 this month.That left it still down around 73% versus its December 2017 record highs at $420. But in light of the latest market dip, the Litecoin price is closer to 80% down from all-time highs.Compare that to Bitcoin, which was last down by only around 14% since last month’s record peaks. BTC was last changing hands in the mid-$63,000s.To be fair to Litecoin, it’s not the only major altcoin that remains a long way below record levels.Solana (SOL) is still down 45% versus its 2021 record peaks. And XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are down around 85%.Bitcoin has been able to recover back to record levels ahead of other coins given bullish narratives such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fact that it faces a favorable regulatory environment worldwide, and the growing idea that it is “digital gold” and therefore a great safe-haven asset and hedge against currency debasement.Litecoin’s Narrative Problem Litecoin, by comparison, is suffering from a significant narrative problem. That is to say, while Litecoin has a lot going for it, it lacks narrative momentum.Litecoin is attempting to position itself as the “digital silver” to complement Bitcoin as “digital gold”. Thanks to its fair launch (a Bitcoin fork) and high level of decentralization, Litecoin is one of the only cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that global regulators widely agree is not a security, meaning it also faces a friendly regulatory environment worldwide.And its blockchain is much faster and cheaper than Bitcoin and able to bare a much higher load.Despite only ranking as the 19th largest crypto by market cap, LTC is the leader in crypto payments.— Litecoin (@litecoin) But the cryptocurrency’s continued adoption as a medium of payment, its intended use case, is failing to lift its price.Indeed, on-chain data this week revealed that a record-high 62.5% of Litecoin investors now qualify as HODLers.'On-chain data shows that Litecoin’s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all investors now qualify as these HODLers.' – — Litecoin (@litecoin) Litecoin Price Prediction – Can LTC Hit $1,000? Record high Litcoin HODLing suggests a lack of retail investor interest in the cryptocurrency. Broader use amongst retail and short-term investors is a key part of a cryptocurrency’s adoption.And an influx of new short-term investors will be needed for the LTC price to drive higher.But the lack of participation by retail/short-term investors is a strong bottom signal for the Litecoin price.The HODLers who now dominate the LTC market are much less likely to sell their coins. The transfer of holdings from weak-handed short-term/retail investors has seemingly already taken place.The bull market in Bitcoin and many other cryptos is well underway. At some point it is likely to bleed into LTC in a more meaningful way.At such a cheap valuation below $100 and with a market cap of $6 billion, Litecoin has a strong risk-reward.Calling a more than 10x rally to $1,000 per token is a big call. Narratives surrounding Litecoin would have to gain a lot more traction.But Litecoin stands a very good chance of posting 5x gains to challenge record highs above $400.The Litecoin price stands a very good chance of posting 5x gains to challenge record highs above $400.

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin’s fourth halving event is imminent and will occur just after midnight UTC on April 20 (8 pm ET today), which will reduce the block subsidy reward for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, potentially impacting the cryptocurrency’s price and mining operations.Bitcoin halvings occur automatically every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. To understand the importance of this event, let’s examine previous halving events and their historical impact on the industry.A Look Back at Previous Bitcoin Halving Events Bitcoin halving events have historically contributed to major Bitcoin price rallies.Bitcoin’s protocol has mandated three halving events thus far, gradually decreasing the block reward for miners from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016, and most recently to 6.25 BTC on May 11, 2020.The 2024 halving event will see the subsidy reward for miners on the network drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. In the long term, only 21 million Bitcoins will exist.\\xa0What comes after 2024’s Halving Event?\\xa0 Bernstein predicts that Bitcoin will continue on its bullish path after the halving event and could reach $150,000 by the end of 2025.\\xa0Coinify CEO Rikke Staer warned about sales after halving in the interview. ☑️ He attributed his expectations to the strengthening presence of institutional investors and the increased experience of retail investors☑️ \"Historically, the main growth after… — Web3_Vibes (@W3Vibes) However, Coinify’s Rikke Staer believes that the halving event is a “sell-the-news” event as less efficient miners may need to sell their existing BTC holdings, which could potentially create sell pressure.While Bitcoin miners have profited this year, the extent the halving will impact less efficient mining operations has yet to be determined.Bitcoin’s price is hovering around $64,500 as of writing, representing a 1.33% increase over the past 24 hours, . Bitcoin’s price fell below $60,000 earlier today amid reports of Israeli missiles hitting a site in Iran but has rebounded strongly since.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum Fueled Up: Will 320 Million USDT Inflow Ignite Price Surge?',\n",
       "  'description': 'The winds of change are swirling around Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. While the Ethereum network itself is buzzing with activity, the price of ETH has taken a tumble in recent days, leaving investors scratching their heads.A glimmer of hope emerged with Tether’s (USDT) recent movement. Tether, the issuer of the world’s most popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, transferred a whopping $318 million worth of USDT from its treasury wallet directly to exchanges on the Ethereum network.This outflow suggests potential anticipation of increased demand for USDT, which could, in turn, signal rising investor interest in the broader cryptocurrency market.Historically, Tether has minted large amounts of USDT during periods of heightened crypto activity, and the rumor mill now churns with speculation that another billion USDT might soon be minted specifically on Ethereum.However, analysts caution against blind optimism. While an increase in USDT activity could bode well for Ethereum, it’s not a guaranteed path to prosperity.Other blockchains, like Tron, are also capable of handling USDT transactions, offering investors alternative avenues.Price Woes And Investor SentimentMeanwhile, the price of ETH has stubbornly refused to cooperate. As of today, ETH is trading below the crucial $3,000 mark, having dropped by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.Ethereum has lost 11% of its value in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.Related Reading: Toncoin Unleashes DeFi Monster Growth: TVL Soars 300% In A MonthA further price drop below $3,000 could trigger panic selling, exacerbating the downward spiral.The current situation presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While Tether’s recent move and steady network activity offer slivers of optimism, the declining price and NFT market correction paint a contrasting picture.A Hive Of Activity Despite Stress On PriceWhile the price of ETH might be feeling the heat, the Ethereum network itself is humming with activity. Unlike the recent slump in the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market, overall network usage has remained remarkably consistent.This suggests a shift in focus within the Ethereum ecosystem. While the flamboyant world of NFTs might be experiencing a temporary correction, other sectors within Ethereum are picking up the slack.The rise in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) transactions, stablecoin swaps, and general token activity could be the hidden forces keeping the network busy.Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView',\n",

       "  'description': 'Hedgey Finance, a token infrastructure platform, has fallen victim to a flash loan attack, resulting in the loss of approximately $44.5 million in digital assets across Ethereum\\'s layer-2 network Arbitrum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The attack occurred within a two-hour window on April 19.According to blockchain security firm Cyvers, the attacker exploited Hedgey\\'s \"createLockedCampaign\" function using flash-loaned funds to drain the platform\\'s assets. The stolen funds were initially swapped to the DAI stablecoin and transferred to an external address .The attacker then repeated the exploit on the Arbitrum chain, stealing an additional $42.8 million after receiving funding on the ETH Chain via FixedFloat.Following the attack, the suspicious address became the primary holder of the BONUS token, the native digital asset of BonusBlock, a project aimed at acquiring and onboarding high-quality users to the Web3 ecosystem. The token\\'s value has since dropped by around 10% to $0.5084, according to on-chain data. The attacker has already begun moving some of the stolen assets, transferring over 200,000 BONUS tokens, worth approximately $110,000, to the Bybit exchange.Hedgey Finance has announced an ongoing investigation into the attack and advised users with active claims to cancel them using the \"End Token Claim\" feature on the platform\\'s website.

       "  'description': \"Andreas Brekken, the founder of , a platform offering direct-to-wallet trading, sat down (in his hammock) for an exclusive interview with the Cryptonews Podcast.Talking with host Matt Zahab, Brekken recalled how difficult it was for people to buy BTC in 2011, noting that the ease of purchase today contributes to its adoption.He remarked that meme coins are actually great for the crypto space because they are fun, cheap to get, and generally harmless. Importantly, they are stress-testing the biggest chains in the sector.The crypto veteran talked about multiple markets happening simultaneously and the potential significance of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade.Brekken also touched upon the necessity to re-examine our interaction with centralized exchanges and the need for services like SideShift.In this interview, Brekken discussed:How increased meme coin trading will show us the limits of current protocols, forcing chains to compete with each other to show who can handle the most traffic.If meme coins are generally good or bad for the crypto space;The Ethereum Dencun upgrade;How products like SideShift encourage mass adoption;Rethinking how we interact with crypto exchanges — particularly as the bull run ushers in a new wave of mainstream adoption;Multiple markets currently happening at the same time;Buying BTC in 2011 vs. today;Brekken gave a wide-ranging exclusive interview, which you can see above or read below.How the Bitcoin Times Have Changed! Brekken discovered Bitcoin in 2011.At that time, he said, there were very few routes for people to get BTC. One option was dark web markets, including the infamous Silk Road.“But in my case, I’m just too much of a nerd,” Brekken remarked. He didn’t know about this avenue at the time.But he had an advantage over an average Joe: he was a programmer.Therefore, Brekken discovered information on BTC online and started learning about the novel technology.Notably, at the time, anyone interested in BTC needed to install a program on their PC to get it. This program would create addresses and allow users to find a place to buy the coin, receive it, and send it.This was obviously a much more difficult system than what we have today.But Brekken said another advantage a programmer or engineer would have at the time is the way they view and think of technology.They seek to understand how it’s made and how they can build upon it. They’ll to to find a way to improve it, create something similar, find another use case, etc.Not every shiny coin on social media will lead to generational wealth.AI recommends DYOR and safe trading.Good job! 🎈 — SideShift.ai – Direct to Wallet Trading (@sideshiftai) Direct-to-Wallet Trading: Recipe for Mass Adoption And this is how SideShift.ai was created. There was a way to make a piece of tech that would help fulfill a demand, and Brekken went for it.The team developed an efficient, easy-to-use, newcomer-friendly platform that offers direct-to-wallet trading.When one uses a centralized crypto exchange, there are many steps to complete before finally getting the coins.This includes all the necessary log-ins, 2FA, KYC, choosing the deposit, finding the network, waiting for confirmations, and so on, says Brekken.However, it can get more complicated in certain cases, such as buying a specific meme coin. For example, the user needs to trade BTC for UDTS first before getting WIF.SideShift.ai performs the trade immediately and delivers the coins to the wallet, the founder said.// USD WEEKLY SHIFT VOLUME – APR 9 TO 15 //SideShift recorded a gross weekly volume of $22.9m alongside a SHIFT count of 11,669 shifts. These figures combined to produce healthy daily averages of $3.3m on 1,667 shifts. — SideShift Research (@XAIResearch) “That’s why we call it direct-to-wallet trading because it’s the only way I know to explain that you don’t have to click 700 buttons in order to do something as simple as just going from what you have to what you want.”There was lots of demand for this service, he added.But speaking of exchanges, Brekken gave a warning: take your funds out.The more long-term view for this industry is that people need to stop leaving their money on exchanges. It’s a huge problem, he said.Simply said, the incentives are not aligned between the user and the exchange.The exchanges have full control over users’ funds and make money off of it.Also, they may use the funds without telling users, be attacked, do a rug pull, etc. There are too many red flags.Oui oui! SideShift about to be available directly in the Ledger wallet — Andreas (@abrkn) AI In Name Only Brekken briefly touched on the ‘AI’ part in ‘SideShift.ai.’“I’m going to be completely honest with you,” he said, “I just thought it sounded really awesome.”The closest the company will get to an actual AI is the amount of automation they’ve done.The company has a small team of people who deal with “quite a lot of volume.”Yet, they keep everything smooth and stable thanks to “excessive automation internally,” Brekken said.There’s very little human intervention, he added. “It’s like a giant machine” running nearly everything.AI advises HUMANS to do their own research to be confident in their financial journey. ATTACHING: Meme for motivationGood job! 🎈 — SideShift.ai – Direct to Wallet Trading (@sideshiftai) However, when talking to customer support, the team “makes it a bit confusing” for people to know if they’re talking to a human, a machine, or a machine pretending to be human.“More likely, you might be talking to a human pretending to be a machine,” Brekken said.And speaking of the team, the founder noted that SideShift.ai is currently hiring for a number of roles, especially engineers.Meme Coins Are Stress-Testing Major Chains Commenting on the ongoing meme coin craze, Brekken said that he himself was “really into” Dogecoin when it launched in 2013.Looking at the craze now, “It was the exact same thing back when there was only Dogecoin, but obviously, this is on steroids.”There are many more of these coins now, many more communities, and more people involved – even those outside the crypto space. It’s difficult to visit a café without overhearing a conversation about WIF or BONK, Brekken remarked.But, generally speaking, meme coins are beneficial for the space, Brekken remarked. “I think it’s good in many ways that people are trading meme coins,” he said.He argued that these coins create fun for friends and communities, that they are harmless, and also an excellent way for people to enter crypto.Bitcoin’s $60,000-$70,000 price tag can be intimidating for newcomers. Once bought, there’s also a lot to lose.But with meme coins, it’s a lot easier to afford and trade them.Degens need something to gamble on, and the shiny new things are memecoins. 🤡Catch all of the PvP action, hot takes and more in this week's spicy newsletter!Read it now: — Shitcoin.com (@ShitcoinDotCom) And this space is growing as well. Now, users have more advanced tools at their disposal trading BONK than they do trading Apple shares, Brekken argued.Additionally, trading meme coins is potentially becoming a competitor to another giant: sports betting.“It’s quality fun with your friends,” Brekken said.Lastly, but importantly, all this activity is stress-testing the technology, specifically the chains these tokens reside and move on.Solana and Ethereum, in particular, are being stress-tested. Different chains are competing. They must work hard not to fall behind and lose users.“I will bet you, [the developers] are all working day and night on all these platforms and chains […] to just keep this running and to try to find ways to deal with this record-level high demand for throughput and capacity,” Brekken said.Multiple Parallel Markets At Work Another exciting point Brekken made is that we currently seem to be witnessing multiple markets happening simultaneously.Previously, we’d see one sector at a time significantly rising above others, each with its own cycle.For example, in the last cycle, there was a decentralized finance (DeFi) summer that turned into a Solana summer. This gradually shifted into a “mania” centered around FTX, and so on.Today, however, we’re seeing the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) taking off, the meme coin market continuation, and a new DeFi wave.It also seems like these three have separate risks and somewhat separate users, Brekken opined.Don't be a piggy in the fight between bulls and the bears.Plan your trades wisely. Good job! 🎈 — SideShift.ai – Direct to Wallet Trading (@sideshiftai) That said, he hopes that the meme coin cycle will continue to attract more newcomers to the space and encourage users within other cycles to explore other crypto-related markets.The bull market has been “creeping up on us since the desperation we all felt” when Bitcoin was $20,000-$25,000.Therefore, Brekken hopes the three different cycles will affect each other positively and prolong this bull run.“If you’re still alive with a good-looking meme coin portfolio [by the end of summer], I think you are a genius,” he added.Ethereum Dencun Upgrade and Path to Sharding Lastly, Brekken briefly discussed certain developments in the space, including the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, which went live in March.The upgrade aimed to significantly boost the Ethereum ecosystem, reduce Ethereum layer-2 blockchain transaction fees, and pave the way for sharding in the future, which will finally lower Ethereum’s high layer-1 fees.What surprised Brekken about these Ethereum upgrades is that everybody connected to the Ethereum ecosystem, including other chains, was fully ready at the moment the update went live.This is a positive development.There is no longer a need to develop separate software for several years to support an upgrade. These are instantaneous now.Another notable thing is the ongoing talk about sharding.Deep dive on Ethereum's sharding roadmap from . It's very good! — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) Sharding is a solution that optimizes the process of verifying transactions and smart contracts by splitting the blockchain network into partitions called shards.This way, every node does not need to review the entire transaction history on the network.Instead, specific nodes are assigned to specific shards, optimizing the process of nodes verifying transactions.This, said Brekken, has the potential to send ETH to $5,000.Therefore, the upgrades we’re seeing now are the developers gradually building a path towards sharding. Brekken said it’s a large project that will likely take a few years to complete.__________About Andreas BrekkenAndreas Brekken is the founder of SideShift.ai, a platform offering direct-to-wallet trading.

       "  'title': ' What is EigenLayer? Ethereum’s restaking protocol, explained ',\n",
       "  'description': ' EigenLayer, explained  EigenLayer aims to eliminate a critical barrier many new DApps face by providing developers with an established security framework.Ethereum has come a long way since its launch in 2015. It has held its position as the most influential blockchain, successfully transitioned from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), and is the foundation for many innovative crypto projects.\\xa0One such project is EigenLayer, a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that provides developers with an established security pool. This EigenLayer explanation details staking and other vital parts of the Ethereum staking protocol.The EigenLayer protocol is an Ethereum-based project aiming to improve the network’s PoS consensus through a process called Ethereum restaking. The EigenLayer team claims to solve many existing Ethereum security inefficiencies, such as requiring every protocol to manage its own security and scalability processes.However, before discussing the EigenLayer restaking process, defining the traditional Ethereum staking process is essential.   What is staking?  Staking is one of crypto’s most popular features, providing traders with a reliable passive income stream.Staking involves locking one’s cryptocurrency in a staking pool, exchange or smart contract. A user earns interest on their staked assets, and in turn, the network utilizes these assets to cultivate network security. The more funds a user stakes, the more passive income they make.High-value stakeholders often become validators who participate in transaction validation and vote on upcoming or existing proposals to improve the network. The idea is that stakers are more invested in protecting the blockchain network and less likely to become bad actors. Staking incentivizes good behavior as well. Validator rewards on Ethereum are slashed if a validator fails to participate in the network’s best interest.Decentralized staking is seen as the more accessible form of transaction validation when compared to PoW. PoW has miners racing to be the first block validator to earn a reward. This process has miners spending thousands on computer equipment to increase their hash rates, meaning those who spend the most earn the most. As these users continue to amass tokens, it becomes even more difficult for new miners to get involved.Staking on Ethereum is similar to holding a savings account in a traditional bank and requires much less effort from the user. Thanks to the advent of staking pools, even users without much money to spare can begin their staking journey.   What is restaking, and how does EigenLayer support it?  Restaking is EigenLayer’s take on traditional staking. It provides new ways for users to generate passive income while increasing network security.\\xa0Restaking, in the case of EigenLayer, is the act of taking staked Ethereum and repurposing it to increase security on other protocols — essentially creating a pool of restaked assets from which other decentralized applications (DApps) can pull. Users can opt-in to EigenLayer’s restaking smart contract through their already staked Ether (ETH) or through a liquid staking token (LST).\\xa0When a user stakes funds on an Ethereum protocol, most projects offer liquid staking tokens to represent those staked assets — a sort of receipt. These tokens allow one to keep using their funds in other ways, such as restaking them through EigenLayer via a process called LST restaking without unstaking their original assets.Alternatively, users can allow EigenLayer’s smart contracts to work with their already-staked ETH. Restaking with already-staked ETH is called native restaking. If a user participates in native restaking, the network will add those assets to the protocol’s security pool. How safe is EigenLayer? It’s about as secure as the size of its security pool.Applications built on EigenLayer are called actively validated services (AVSs) and can be anything from a bridge to a DApp to an oracle. Developing on EigenLayer is cheaper and more efficient than developing on a separate protocol, as EigenLayer has an established trust network in place through restakers. Developing elsewhere requires building a trust network from scratch.That said, AVSs aren’t randomly harnessing services from EigenLayer. Instead, there’s an intermediary called a node operator, a volunteer opting to help manage the network. Much like an Ethereum validator, an operator can be a single user or an organization.\\xa0Operators can build their own AVSs or provide services to other existing AVSs while receiving rewards in return. However, operators are also subject to an AVS’s slashing requirements should they fail to perform their duties.Moreover, operators can be restakers, or restakers can choose to delegate their restaked assets to an operator. Either way, restakers have complete control over which services their assets go toward. As a result, EigenLayer creates a sort of free-market governance system. Developers build on EigenLayer to harness its established security, while operators and restakers earn rewards for managing and providing said security.\\xa0   How do restakers manage their restaked assets?  EigenLayer streamlines asset management through its EigenPod solution.Users must connect their wallet to the EigenLayer application and select the token they want to restake. First-time restakers must approve the process before depositing funds into EigenLayer’s restaking contract.A restaker manages their restaked assets through an EigenPod, a smart contract created during the restaker’s initial restaking process. An EigenPod is essentially a hub for the restaker to manage restaking processes, withdrawals and more. There can only be one EigenPod per Ethereum wallet address.Restakers can visualize their network contributions through EigenLayer’s restaked points. Users earn restaked points every time a block is validated from their restaking date onward. EigenLayer calculates a user’s restaked points through a proprietary formula that factors the amount of restaked assets and the time they’ve been locked in. The formula views native restaked ETH and restaked LST equally.Users can withdraw their staking rewards on EigenLayer through a partial or full withdrawal process. Restakers who want to withdraw their earned rewards but continue providing services go through a partial withdrawal process. Partial withdrawals require on-chain proofs, and their gas fees can be expensive. Restakers can request one partial withdrawal every four to five days, and withdrawn funds must go through an additional escrow period before appearing in the restaker’s wallet.Full withdrawals are for restakers who no longer want to provide their services. Otherwise, the process is similar to a partial withdrawal, requiring on-chain proofs and an escrow period for withdrawn funds. If a restaker accidentally initiates a full withdrawal, they can redelegate their assets via EigenPod’s “redeposit” button. Restakers can initiate either withdrawal process through their EigenPod’s “Unstake” section.   Pros and cons of EigenLayer  EigenLayer features innovative solutions, though this Ethereum network upgrade also introduces its own problems.EigenLayer hopes to innovate on Ethereum’s tried-and-true proof-of-stake feature. In some ways, it is doing just that. However, its innovations aren’t perfect and can lead to new problems.ProsAdditional passive revenueSince restakers can use their staked assets in additional ways, they have the potential to earn higher rewards than traditional staking methods.Improving developer success ratesEigenLayer’s security pool eliminates a key barrier many new projects struggle to overcome. Now, developers can focus on providing valuable services without worrying about establishing trust.By removing one of the most significant barriers that newer projects face, EigenLayer could lead to genuinely innovative layer-2 projects.\\xa0ConsHigher barrier to entryWhile EigenLayer benefits new DApps by providing them with established security, restaking to participate in the network may overwhelm some users. Many crypto exchanges offer staking as a built-in service, simplifying node setup and maintenance for users on the network. That accessibility comes at the cost of technical know-how. If less technical users are already comfortable with the staking process, they will unlikely be interested in restaking.Increased riskEigenLayer AVSs have slashing rules that are different from traditional staking. Since restakers hold assets in traditional staking and restaking avenues, they’re doubling their slashing risk should they fail to uphold their duties.Not only this, but restakers are doubling their exposure to security risks. Stakers already trust Ethereum’s smart contract code when they stake assets, and restaking requires trust in EigenLayer’s development prowess. This isn’t to mention the quality of EigenLayer AVSs.\\xa0Fortunately, both Ethereum and EigenLayer’s code is entirely open-source. Knowledgeable developers can assess this code before risking their assets. ',\n",

       "  'description': \"The governance token for synthetic dollar protocol Ethena (ENA) has shed 33% over the last week as it begins Friday morning UTC trading at $0.9632.While this is one of the heaviest intra-week losses for a top 100 cryptocurrency, ENA looks set for a quick recovery. In the last 24 hours it has grown in price by about 10%.These figures reflect a more volatile token than the market leaders. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) declined by 9% and 12% respectively.The original cryptocurrency and the only coin with a market cap above a trillion, Bitcoin, recovered 5% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, the coin underpinning the most commercially important blockchain, recaptured about 4% overnight.Ethena: A PrimerCentral to Ethena’s ecosystem is the token, USDe, a stablecoin that stays pegged to the greenback through a\\xa0delta-hedging strategy. The protocol uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as reserves, and offsets their price fluctuations around by holding perpetual futures shorting both assets.One of the popular uses of USDe is staking. According to the , there is around $2.4 billion total value locked (TVL) on the platform between nearly 160,000 users. The current annual yield is about 11.2%. This is a seven-day rolling average, although the figure is sharp decline from yesterday, when yield was .However, a new report by CryptoQuant warned USDe holders yesterday that Ethena’s keep rate (the portion of revenue allocated to its reserve fund) needs to stay above 32% in a bear market to avoid risks.\\xa0ENA began trading on April 2 at around 79 cents and its price chart since tells a story of relative stability as the token maintains support at a dollar. The highest ENA climbed was $1.52 on April 11, but today’s price represents a 37% pullback. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 66 and climbing, investors appear to be buying today. Source: TradingView Ethena (ENA) and Unbacked Stablecoins: Risky Territory?  The Ethena protocol appears to be one of the most cutting-edge and fastest-growing crypto ecosystems in recent history. However, the promise of a stablecoin that is not backed by cash and cash equivalents has more than a few investors wary.That’s because the industry has seen it all before with Terraform Labs’s UST, a token that was supposed to stay at $1 through a burn/mint mechanism that involved burning $1 worth of an unbacked token called LUNA to mint $1 worth of the so-called algorithmically backed UST and vice versa.Like USDe, UST also promised attractive yields for anyone staking it in a lending protocol called Anchor. However, when yields declined, UST began to lose popularity.The token began to wobble from the dollar in May 2022, which then made more people flock to the exits in a self-fulfilling cycle that ended up exponentially destabilizing UST’s pegging mechanism while sending LUNA into a hyper-inflationary spiral that only concluded once a staggering 7 trillion LUNA tokens were minted.The knock-on effects from the collapse were the primary catalyst for the industry’s 2022 recession, which ended in dozens of bankruptcies across the industry.From Ethena’s Uncertainty to Slothana’s HilarityGiven the fresh memories of UST and the warnings in yesterday’s CryptoQuant report, there is still a lot of uncertainty around Ethena’s ENA and USDe tokens.However, meme coins could post some solid rallies in the near-future.

       "  'description': 'The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event seems to be holding the crypto market together and an increased volatility shows that. Amidst high hopes, Bitcoin price briefly crossed the $65,000 mark on but after dipping below the $60,000 level. However, the same kind of down and up was mirrored in other cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin halving to lead bull run?The halving’s impact on the crypto market still remains a major topic of debate. If we backtrack a bit, previous cycles have seen bull runs following the completion of the event. Bitcoin has recorded high price rallies after prior halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Crypto enthusiasts expect a similar price boost this time, but many analysts remain skeptical.After witnessing high selling pressure over the past few weeks, Bitcoin printed red indexes. Some external events, such as geopolitical tensions like Iran’s recent drone and missile attack on Israel have added to this pressure. However, the positive momentum among the traders has allowed BTC to recover in speedy action.Bitcoin price jumped by over 4% in the last 24 hours after dropping below the $60K mark. The last 7 days have proved to be not so good for BTC as its price declined by more than 8% in this period. The biggest crypto price fell from over $70k to under $60k in a span of just 8 days.BTC is trading at an average price of $65,012, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 15% to stand at $50.4 billion. Its market cap stands at $1.2 billion.Miners’ sell offThis volatile trading precedes the halving, a phase where miners typically reduce selling pressure, capitalizing on higher revenues before the reward reduction. Data suggests that miners have already executed a heavy selling. This benefited the market in the short term.The halving occurs approximately every four years and was added to Bitcoin’s code by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. This was done as a mechanism to limit the supply of bitcoins.The halving functions by reducing the rewards for miners that they receive for creating new tokens. It effectively increases the cost of producing new bitcoins. Meanwhile, this event follows Bitcoin’s recent price surge to an all-time high of $73,803.25 in March.It is important to note that this rally was fueled by optimism that emerged due to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January.',\n",

The altcoin has since been holding above the $3,000 mark, and investors seeing this are pushing for further increases in price.This is because a large chunk of the circulating supply is constrained within a 20% rally. According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM), about 9.14 million ETH worth over $27.4 billion was bought under $3,537 and $3,118.Given that this massive supply is sitting within a relatively smaller rally, ETH holders will certainly not give up until this supply bears profit.This sentiment is substantiated by the Net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator. This metric highlights the potential profits or losses the investors would obtain at market price should they move to sell.When NUPL is high, investors are in profit, suggesting potential sell-offs; when low, it may signal accumulation or buying opportunities. In other moments, the metric is divided into zones to understand investors’ mindsets.Currently, ETH is in the Optimism zone, which has historically been the trigger zone for price rallies.Despite the correction, the NUPL in this zone is evidence that Ethereum’s price still has the potential to note a rally once again.ETH Price Prediction: A Bounce Back From This Support LevelEthereum’s price trading around $3,000 is fighting hard to ensure this price point is not lost as support. Given that the investors are currently heavily bullish, ETH has the opportunity to bounce back.The most likely outcome is a potential 20% rally that would send the altcoin beyond $3,500. This would require ETH to first breach and flip the resistance of $3,376 into support. Completing the rally would also make the aforementioned supply profitable, driving investors toward the asset.On the other hand, Ethereum’s price will fall to test the crucial support of $2,736 if this support is lost. Losing this would invalidate the bullish thesis, causing a further decline in the asset price.',\n",

       "  'title': 'DeFi’s Explosive Start to 2024: OnChain Report Reveals Key Growth Drivers',\n",
       "  'description': 'Q1 2024 has marked a significant resurgence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. According to an article by Cointelegraph, citing data from DefiLlama, the TVL in DeFi platforms surged from a low of $36 billion in Q4 2023 to a peak of almost $97 billion in the first three months of 2024. This upward trend continued, reaching a two-year high of $98 billion last week, indicating an 81% increase since the start of the year.\\xa0A joint report (titled: “The OnChain Report: 2024 Q1″) by QuickNode, a blockchain infrastructure platform that makes it easy for developers and businesses to build and scale Web3 applications, and Artemis, a data analytics platform, noted that “staking, liquid staking, restaking, and liquid restaking have all been key drivers behind DeFi’s recent rapid expansion” before adding that “this is why staking now accounts for a significant share of DeFi’s total value locked (TVL).”The Cointelegraph article went on to say that one of the standout protocols in this boom has been Lido, which dominates the liquid staking ecosystem with a 62% market share. Lido’s success helped to push the liquid staking TVL to an all-time high of $63 billion on March 13. It also mentioned that another notable performer, EigenLayer, saw its TVL skyrocket by 990% during the same period, ending the quarter with $12 billion. EigenLayer has introduced the capability for ETH to be staked multiple times for additional yields, adding a new layer of utility and incentive in the DeFi space.According to the authors of the report, there has been a notable 42% quarter-over-quarter increase in stablecoin user activity. This surge is primarily driven by several key factors: the approval and listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the forthcoming Bitcoin halving in April, a significant migration away from hyperinflated fiat currencies, and a revival in the popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.The report highlights a new era for DeFi in the first quarter of 2024, marked by renewed optimism, heightened risk awareness, and refined innovation. A striking 291% increase in user activity from the previous quarter has sparked expectations of a second ‘DeFi Summer.’ This anticipated growth suggests a transformative shift in the sector, despite ongoing regulatory challenges from entities such as the SEC.Web3 gaming emerged as a standout category, as noted in the report, with a significant 155% quarter-over-quarter increase in active addresses. This growth underscores Web3’s capacity to attract and maintain a growing player base, showcasing the sector’s potential for sustained engagement.The authors also point to the rapid expansion of Layer 2 solutions as a critical development over the last six months. Notable platforms like Arbitrum and Base have seen substantial growth in total value locked (TVL), indicating a robust appetite for expanding on-chain liquidity, which is essential for the broader proliferation of Web3 technologies.Featured Image via Pixabay',\n",

       "  'title': ' Why financial infrastructure needs to be open-source — Hyperledger ',\n",
       "  'description': 'Open-source governance and development tools remain prerequisites for governments, organizations and financial institutions that want to leverage blockchain technology.Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph at Paris Blockchain Week, Hyperledger executive director Daniela Barbosa discussed why open-source blockchain technology is a non-negotiable requirement for global institutions.Barbosa, who also serves as the general manager of the Linux Foundation, said shifting critical financial infrastructure onto blockchain protocols hinges on the underlying network being open-source and open governance. “All around the world, organizations are selecting Hyperledger families to work with because they know it’s under the Linux Foundation. It’s under that open governance and open development, and it has the backing of major companies, governments and organizations,” Barbosa explained.The Hyperledger director said that organizations tapping into their technology stack care not only that the tools are open-source but that there is open development and an active community of diverse maintainers and code contributors.“Nobody wants to build new rails on code that one company owns. If that company goes out of business or changes its mind and says we’re no longer open source, you must pay license fees to continue using what you built.”Barbosa also believes the Linux Foundation’s focus is on fostering open governance and the development of tools under its umbrella. She highlighted critical infrastructure like Linux Kernel’s use in a myriad of computing systems as an example of the embeddedness of open-source infrastructure. “For the last 25 years, the Linux Foundation has been building open source communities and the most important code. Think Linux Kernel and Kubernetes. Essentially, all cloud computing runs on Kubernetes,” Barbosa said.The Linux Foundation GM said that several organizations have made efforts to open-source their software and code. However, she questioned whether making this information openly useable on GitHub does enough to make the tools openly developed and governed. “That’s what the foundation does; we bring that open governance and development. Banks who compete with one another can come and collaborate. Companies like Accenture and IBM could collaborate on things for the community,” Barbosa explained.She added that this is an essential long-term consideration for the financial services industry in the event that regulators begin to probe who owns what and makes changes to the underlying code.Barbosa also unpacked the development history of Hyperledger’s blockchain tools. Hyperledger Besu, a prominent Ethereum execution client, has become one of its most important infrastructure offerings.Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Java Ethereum execution client. It offers public and private functionality and can run all Ethereum smart contracts. Users can use all Ethereum token standards, including nonfungible token standards ERC-20 and ERC-721.“By 2019, institutions were very interested in Ethereum ecosystem. This was the contribution that came in from Consensys around the time that the Hyperledger Foundation and Ethereum Enterprise Alliance joined forces,” Barbosa said.Barbosa cited on-chain data that reflects 12% of Ethereum mainnet users running Hyperledger Besu as an execution client. Consensys Linea runs on the client, as well as Hedera Hashgraph. ',\n",

       "  'title': 'Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Halving Mark Milestones – What Lies Ahead for Crypto?',\n",
       "  'description': 'Amid the whirlwind caused by the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the looming Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency market remains abuzz with excitement and anticipation.These recent developments have shaken the industry. But enthusiasts eagerly await the next catalysts to drive the ecosystem to new heights.Just one day before the highly anticipated halving event, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a surge in popularity, coinciding with a rise in the underlying asset’s price. However, flows to these three-month-old products declined into negative territory earlier this week.The halving, a phenomenon that occurs roughly every four years for Bitcoin, is expected to occur between April 19 and 20. It involves a planned reduction in the reward that companies receive for mining the cryptocurrency.On Thursday, Deutsche Bank analysts said Bitcoin prices are unlikely to see significant increases\\xa0following the halving. They argue that since the Bitcoin algorithm has already accounted for the halving event, its impact has already been priced into the market.Ethereum Apps To Drive Sustainable Crypto Yields Sunand Raghupathi, CEO of Seven Seas Capital, noted how Bitcoin and Ethereum have led the charge in attracting ETF interest. Now, other crypto services and products are grabbing attention too, not just from individuals but also from big institutions.He mentioned that after these ETFs, the market might see more cool and sustainable ways for people and businesses to earn yield. This could mean using Ethereum apps to earn native rewards and tokenize all sorts of stuff, from real-world assets to stablecoins.Tokenization involves the conversion of real-world assets into digital representations stored on a blockchain ledger.“I think there are many, many applications on the Ethereum network that provide these sorts of yields, and their adoption will increasingly pick up,” he told Cryptonews.Raghupathi pointed out that Ethereum is seen as the safest and most decentralized blockchain. And big players like BlackRock are already thinking about using Ethereum to tokenize all kinds of assets.Crypto Games To Attract Diverse Player Base Fueled by rising adoption of various crypto products across Asia, the market seems poised for further growth. Many Asian governments are also taking a proactive and supportive approach to the industry.Rebecca Liao, CEO of Layer-1 protocol Saga, said this approach bodes well for the future. In line with this, she anticipates several catalysts emerging on the heels of the newly launched Bitcoin ETFs.A potential catalyst, she suggests, could be breakthroughs in the realm of crypto gaming. With its massive player base, particularly in Asia, Liao believes the gaming world has the potential to become a major facet of the crypto industry.“There’s been a tremendous amount of building of, and investment in, gaming products. It’s only a matter of time,” she said.SocialFi Promises User-Centric Social Network Institutional investors are also catching on to the wave that early adopters rode long ago. According to Tristan Bandoni, co-founder of League.Tech, this trend is paving the way for a key development: SocialFi.SocialFi refers to creating blockchain-based alternatives to existing social media platforms. According to Bandoni, the problems with current centralized platforms include users needing more financial reward for their engagement and their data is harvested for unclear purposes.SocialFi projects aim to disrupt this model, empowering creators and users alike. Under this model, influencers are able to monetize their content directly, or users receive rewards for their activity. This shift in control and ownership is what excites Bandoni about the future of SocialFi.“We’re still in the early stages of this as the industry works to offer features and incentives that meaningfully impact user growth beyond crypto natives, but I think we are closer to a breakout for SocialFi networks and usage than many think,” he said.',\n",

This adjustment occurs amid broader market uncertainties but also as the crypto community turns its attention to the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event. This significant moment is anticipated not only for its immediate impact on mining rewards but also for its potential long-term influence on Bitcoin’s price and scarcity. The halving event, which cyclically adjusts the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, has historically been a catalyst for notable price movements and is closely watched by investors for signs of how it might shape market dynamics in the coming years. Bitcoin Halving Approaches: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Legacy and Impact on Cryptocurrency Value As the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches in the next 36 hours, the cryptic words of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, resurface, adding an air of mystique to this significant event. Nakamoto, who disappeared three years after Bitcoin’s inception, left behind a legacy that continues to influence the cryptocurrency’s core principles.Galaxy’s analysis draws a parallel between Nakamoto’s critiques of traditional currency depreciation and Bitcoin’s halving mechanism, which is set to reduce the block reward on April 20, 2024.On April 20, 2024, Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving on block number 840,000.Satoshi Nakamoto programmed the halving feature in Bitcoin as a countermeasure to the continuous debasement of fiat currencies.“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust…— Galaxy (@galaxyhq) This event not only reinforces Bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy and scarcity but also reaffirms its foundational value proposition.

Historically, halvings have resulted in substantial price increases over the following year, though they are initially met with skepticism due to limited historical data.Bitwise points out that halving the supply of new coins inherently boosts scarcity, which could drive prices up. CEO Matt Hougan remains bullish, forecasting a Bitcoin price of over $200,000 this year, influenced by the halving’s significant impact. This perspective could shape market behavior and investor sentiment both before and after the event.Market dynamics may be influenced by anticipated halving effects.Bitwise CEO predicts Bitcoin to surpass $200,000 due to increased scarcity.Historical halvings suggest significant post-event price increases.Bitcoin Investors Show Strong Faith: $1.7 Billion Moved to Accumulation Wallets Amid Price Drop During the recent downturn in the Bitcoin market, hodlers demonstrated their commitment by transferring a into “accumulation” wallets as prices fell below $63,000. This movement, which occurred on April 16 and 17, involved over 27,700 BTC, indicating a robust buying interest at these levels.These wallets, characterized by holdings of over 10 BTC and a history of no withdrawals, reflect long-term investor confidence. Analysts believe this influx of funds represents a strategic accumulation phase, mirroring previous cycles around Bitcoin halvings. They suggest that this could potentially set the stage for a significant rally post-halving, accelerating Bitcoin’s positive momentum.Potential for significant post-halving rally anticipated.Over 27,700 BTC moved, signaling strong buying interest.$1.7 billion transferred to accumulation wallets during market dip.Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently priced at $64,520, experiencing a decline of 1.65%.

       "  'description': 'Analysts at the biggest bank in the US – JP Morgan, says Bitcoin halving is already priced in. This time, the implication would be mainly on Bitcoin mining rather than BTC price, they wrote in a research report.Bitcoin mining – a four-year event that slashes Bitcoin mining rewards in half – is set to occur around April 19-20.JP Morgan authors noted that they do not expect to see post-halving price rise as the event “has already been already priced in.” The experts stressed caution, noting to the possibility the gains have already been realized.Cited by , the analysts wrote that the market is still in overbought conditions. Further, the report stressed that Bitcoin miners will be most affected by the event.Miners who are pre-prepared for the halving have likely laid the groundwork ahead of time by perhaps raising new capital.However, “as unprofitable Bitcoin miners exit the Bitcoin network, we anticipate a significant drop in the hashrate and consolidation among Bitcoin miners with a highest share for publicly-listed Bitcoin miners,” the report read.That said, per a , total miner revenue slumped one month after each Bitcoin halvings held previously. Although, the revenue rebounded significantly later, thanks to BTC price increase and miners expanding their operations.JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote that post the upcoming having, some Bitcoin mining firms might look to diversify their operations to low-energy cost regions such as Latin America. This is “to locate their inefficient mining supply and gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle.”Bitcoin Halving Has Already Been Factored in the Market: Deutsche Bank On a similar note, analysts from Deutsche Bank have also stressed that there would be no significant rally expected post-event. They wrote that Bitcoin halving already factored into prices.Deutsche Bank analysts Marion Laboure and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace suggest that the market has already partially priced in the halving.Per the analysts, the hashrate after three Bitcoin halvings in the past have plummeted by 25%, 11%, and 25%. This is because some miners are priced out of the market, they wrote. Hasrate is the measure of total mining capacity of the crypto industry.“Participating in the process of guessing the hash and adding a block to the blockchain becomes less profitable as the reward to mining decreases.”Despite price fluctuations, analysts are optimistic that BTC price would remain high, given the spot Ethereum ETF approval anticipation.“Adding to that, a surge in layer-2 solutions and DeFi activity, which augment the network’s practical utility, and the setup begins to look remarkably favorable for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the wider crypto space,” the authors wrote.',\n",

He said the asset will not achieve its marketed role as an inflation hedge or a store of value until its user base surpasses 1 billion.“Right now, it’s going to be way more volatile than people like,” he said. “And people look at it as a risk-on or risk-off trade until we get to that adoption.”His comments came before Bitcoin dipped below $60,000 on Friday amidst heightened geopolitical tensions.

Iran’s Fars news agency reported hearing three explosions near a military base in Isfahan, a central city. An Iranian official reportedly , attributing the explosions to the activation of Iran’s air defense systems.During geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, investors tend to become more cautious and seek safer assets to protect their investments. Traditionally, they turn to assets like gold and government bonds for safety.Scaramucci went on to express optimism regarding Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. He anticipates factors like the recent Spot ETF launch, the entry of major financial institutions, and the upcoming halving event to potentially propel Bitcoin’s value toward $200,000.Additionally, he dismissed concerns about excessive centralization due to ETFs.

       "  'description': 'Blockchain network Ethereum is on the path to $1 billion in annualized profits after it netted income of $365 million in Q1, coming alongside a year-on-year quarterly revenue growth of 155%.The network’s 2024 first-quarter income is a nearly 200% bump from the $123 million profit in Q4 2023, according to an April 17 report from The DeFi Report analyst Michael Nadeau.Ethereum’s fee revenue — earned through users paying for transactions — hit $1.17 billion, up 155% from Q1 2023 and an 80% increase from the prior quarter.Increased network activity “primarily driven by a surge in DeFi activity during the quarter” was the cause of the revenue bump, Nadeau said.The activity surge has seen average daily transactions on the blockchain in 2024 already surpass last year’s figures and are closing in on the results from Ethereum’s peak in 2021.Over 1.15 million average daily transactions have taken place in 2024, slightly up from the 1.05 million last year and just shy of the 1.25 million recorded in 2021.Ethereum was launched in 2015 but only had its first profitable year in 2023 — earning $623 million — despite its revenues that year being 75% lower than its peak $9.9 billion 2021 revenues.“This is largely due to the move to proof-of-stake consensus in September of ‘22 — in which token incentives paid to miners (now validators) dropped roughly 80%,” Nadeau explained.He added Ethereum’s fees have grown at a rate of 58% since 2017.“Crypto will outperform everything else” in the years aheadNadeau gave his market predictions for the coming years and concluded that “crypto will outperform everything else.”He expected rising liquidity conditions for the “next few years” as the United States has a large amount of debt needing refinancing this year and the market had priced in three rate cuts this year from the Federal Reserve. “This should provide a tailwind for risk assets such as tech stocks and quality crypto.” exchange-traded funds, the Bitcoin halving and what Nadeau called “the innovation cycle” were three additional catalysts “pointing to a bullish setup for the next few years.”The U.S. spot Bitcoin The Bitcoin ETFs will serve as a “gateway drug” for increased interest in cryptocurrencies as they enable broad access and the halving — slated for April 20 — “has historically led to a bull run in the year after.”The “innovation cycle” will also draw in new venture funding and renew retail interest in crypto as it matures, Nadeau believed. are “quite correlated” — Bitcoin outperforms early in the bull market as it is the most recognizable cryptocurrency while ETH and altcoins tend to outperform it in the later stages of the cycle.He claimed Bitcoin and Ether “It’s noteworthy that altcoins actually rallied so much in the last two cycles that they outperformed Bitcoin across the full length of both cycles,” Nadeau added.He believed this would continue but only with altcoins “that have clear product market fit.”',\n",

       "  'title': ' Degen Chain L3 now tops the TPS charts within the Ethereum ecosystem ',\n",
       "  'description': 'Degen Chain, a new Ethereum layer-3 network, has recorded the highest transaction per second (TPS) count in the Ethereum ecosystem over the last 24 hours.Degen’s TPS count increased 62% over the last day to notch 35.7 TPS — beating out the blockchain it was built on, Base, at 29.7 TPS, according to L2BEAT.Arbitrum One, Ethereum and zkSync Era rounded out the top five.Multiplying Degen’s 35.7 TPS by 86,400 seconds in a day means the memecoin chain processed 3.08 million transactions over that timeframe.But Degen Chain has only notched $819,600 in trading volume over the last day, placing it 35th out of 44 blockchains tracked by CoinGecko.This means the average value per transaction was a mere $0.27 — which is much lower compared to Ethereum and Base at $1,867 and $170 respectively.While TPS is widely used to measure a blockchain’s scalability limits, several industry leaders say it is a flawed metric — as it fails to consider the computational size of each transaction. “[It] is a bit like counting the number of bills in your wallet but ignoring that some are singles, some are twenties, and some are hundreds,” explained Steven Goldfeder, a founder at Offchain Labs who recently spoke with Cointelegraph Magazine.The memecoin turned chain is powered by the Degen (DEGEN) token, which initially started out as a tipping token for users interacting with Degen’s channel on Farcaster — a decentralized social media platform.This is a textbook example of how a memecoin can actually accrue social value, according to Thomas Tang, a vice president of investments at cryptocurrency venture capital firm Ryze Labs.“It’s gained massive mass popularity because everyone’s tipping each other, and everyone holds it,” Tang told Cointelegraph.“So they built a layer 3, based on that.” There is currently $4.1 million in total value locked on Degen Chain, while the three-month-old DEGEN token boasts a market capitalization of $326 million, according to CoinGecko.Degen Chain is considered an ultra-low-cost, application-specific layer 3 blockchain which was built with Arbitrum Orbit and leverages the settlement layer of Base, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin price predictionAmid fluctuating market conditions, Bitcoin‘s price has dipped to $60,547, signaling a 1.74% decrease in the last 24 hours. This movement underpins ongoing volatility as traders and analysts closely monitor trends to update their Bitcoin price prediction. Despite this recent downturn, Bitcoin continues to dominate the with a robust trading volume of $40.55 billion and a market capitalization nearing $1.19 trillion.Bitcoin Price Prediction The technical analysis for Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows it navigating through a challenging phase. The pivot point for today’s session is at $62,216, a level that Bitcoin struggles to reclaim. Immediate resistance lies significantly higher at $64,606, with further barriers at $67,695 and $70,959 suggesting a steep climb for any potential recovery. Conversely, support levels are established at $59,418, and if this fails, the next cushions are at $56,271 and $53,182. A key indicator of market sentiment, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is at 40, signaling that Bitcoin is potentially oversold but still under considerable selling pressure as it remains below the midline of 50. This suggests that the current bearish trend may persist unless there is a significant shift in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Prediction The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $65,415, further reinforcing the resistance around the $62,200 level. This configuration of the EMA confirms the resistance created by the downward channel, adding a technical obstacle to Bitcoin’s upward mobility.In conclusion, the outlook for Bitcoin is currently bearish below the key pivot of $62,216. Should Bitcoin manage to break above this threshold, it could indicate a shift to a more bullish sentiment. However, as long as the price remains below this level, the path of least resistance appears to be downward, with potential targets located at lower support levels.Unlock Cryptocurrency Rewards: Join the 99Bitcoins Presale Now!  99Bitcoins,\\xa0a trailblazer in digital education, innovates cryptocurrency learning with its ‘learn-to-earn’ system.

       "  'title': ' Bitcoin fees top Ethereum for 3 days in a row as halving approaches ',\n",
       "  'description': 'Fees on Bitcoin have surpassed Ethereum for three consecutive days as miners and traders prepare for the upcoming Bitcoin halving and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of Runes on Bitcoin.\\xa0miners cashed in $7.47 million in fees on April 17 — about $160,000 more than the $7.31 million paid to Ethereum stakers, according to Crypto Fees. Bitcoin\\xa0Bitcoin miners also raked in $9.98 million and $5.91 million across April 15 and 16 — beating out Ethereum stakers by $3.5 million and 1.1 million on those respective days.Ethereum, however, maintains a narrow lead on a seven-day average fee basis at $8.55 million compared with Bitcoin’s $7.57 million.Bitcoin transaction fees are determined by the size or data volume of the transaction and blockspace demand at the time of the transaction request.The uptick in Bitcoin fees comes at a crucial time for Bitcoin miners, as April 20’s Bitcoin halving event will result in the mining subsidy being sliced from 6.25 BTC ($398,000) to 3.125 BTC ($199,000).Currently, about 900 BTC is mined per day, which equates to about $57.2 million at current prices. Using April 17’s $7.47 million fee count, this means transaction fees accounted for 11.5% of the Bitcoin mining industry’s total block rewards.However, the share of block rewards from transaction fees will increase considerably after the halving event, as approximately 450 BTC will be mined then. Miners will, therefore, rely more on higher fees and a continued increase in Bitcoin’s price to make up for the revenue fall that it will experience — at least in the short term — from the halving. Meanwhile, the introduction of NFT-like Ordinals inscriptions in January 2023 has helped Bitcoin miners chalk up more revenue from transaction fees — and a new revenue stream will become available when Runes, a new Bitcoin token standard, is released when the halving occurs at block 840,000.China has a Trojan Horse in US Bitcoin mining infrastructureRelated: Runes will compete with Ordinals by aiming to make it easier to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin for memecoin enthusiasts and other community-driven audiences.Its creator, Casey Rodarmor — who also invented Ordinals — said Runes are fully UTXO-based and, therefore, should not spam Bitcoin to the same extent that Ordinals has.The recent uptick in Bitcoin fees may have been partially driven by a decline in BRC-20 token prices in recent days as some trader attention shifts to Runes.Ordinals (ORDI) and Sats (SATS), the two largest BRC-20s by market capitalization, have seen falls of 38% and 43%, respectively, over the last week, according to CoinMarketCap.Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love cryptoMagazine: ',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bitcoin (BTC) Drops Below $60,000, Ethereum (ETH) Says Goodbye to $3,000, Solana (SOL) Strength Disappears: Is Bull Market Over?',\n",
       "  'description': \"The Bitcoin roller coaster has taken another dive, breaking below the $60,000 mark and unsettling the market. This recent dip sees the cryptocurrency dipping its toes into the $58,000 territory, the least-expected move by the market. The fall through what many considered a solid support level at $60,000 is causing some panic.This unsettling movement could have been seen as a dark cloud, but there is a silver lining that has the crypto faithful watching the calendar: the Bitcoin halving. Slated for around April 20, this event is historically known for shaking up the market in unexpected ways. The halving could tighten supply and potentially swing the pendulum back in favor of higher prices. Chart by TradingView\\xa0Looking at the charts with a magnifying glass, we can see that Bitcoin's next support test lies at $58,572, just a stone's throw from where it is currently. If it fails to hold this line, the descent might continue toward the $50,319 area, where the next safety net lies.But let's not write off Bitcoin just yet. If it can rally back and crack through the $60,000 ceiling again, it might just push back to its recent comfort zone. The first sign of recovery will be reclaiming ground above this critical level, with eyes then set on the $68,789 marker — a formidable resistance that could block the path to its previous highs.Ethereum's farewell\\xa0Ethereum's slide below $3,000 is more than just a number — it is a signal. It tells us that the confidence that was pushing prices up is shaky. The drop has been steep enough to make even the staunchest supporters a bit nervous about what's coming next.We have spotted some levels that could tell us where things might head. Right now, Ethereum is testing the waters below the $3,000 line. If it does not climb back up soon, the next floor might be around the $2,800 mark, a point that could offer some resistance to the fall. On the chance that Ethereum finds its feet again, watch out for the $3,200 ceiling — it is the next battle to win for recovery hopes.There is a real chance that ETH could keep dropping, especially if it does not get back above $3,000 quickly. But with the halving in play, it is too early to count it out. A surge of inflows to the market might change the situation in favor of bulls quicker than anticipated.Solana remains suppressedSolana, the cryptocurrency that has been on many investors' watchlists, is showing signs of strain. After a period of growth, SOL has slipped through what was a strong support level at around $130, and now folks are worried. If prices keep heading south and pass below the $100 mark, it could spell real trouble.Key indicators that many traders look to for signs of healing, like RSI and moving averages, have been breached. Currently, Solana struggles to find a proper footing for the price.The situation looks tense. With the support at $130 now a thing of the past, the next checkpoint is at $100. Yet, not all hope is lost. There is still a chance for a turnaround. Growth could be around the corner if Solana manages to rally and break through resistance levels, particularly around $150, which could act as a ladder to climb back up from its current position.The future of Solana is not set in stone. If it finds strength and pushes above these resistance levels, it might just regain its previous momentum. But if it continues to fall, the drop below $100 could be a hard reality check for the coin and its investors.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ethereum Blockchain’s Q1 2024 Success: Unveiling The Factors Behind The $370M Profit Surge',\n",
       "  'description': 'Not only has Ethereum (ETH) seen an impressive rise of nearly 100% in the first quarter of 2024 in terms of price action, but the Ethereum blockchain has also generated substantial profits of up to $369 million during this period. This unexpected profitability has raised questions about how a blockchain like Ethereum can be profitable.\\xa0Ethereum Revenue PotentialAs noted in a recent analysis by the on-chain data platform Token Termina, the collection of transaction fees is a critical aspect of Ethereum’s business model.\\xa0All network users are required to pay fees in ETH when interacting with applications on the blockchain, which serves as an important source of revenue for Ethereum.Once transaction fees are paid, a portion of the ETH is burned and permanently removed from circulation. This process, commonly referred to as “ETH buyback,” benefits existing ETH holders, as the reduction in supply increases the scarcity and value of the remaining ETH tokens. Thus, the daily burning of ETH contributes to the economic benefit of those holding Ethereum.In contrast to the burning of ETH, Ethereum also issues new ETH tokens as rewards to the network’s validators for each new block added to the blockchain.\\xa0These rewards are similar to traditional stock-based compensation and are designed to incentivize validators to secure and maintain the network’s integrity.\\xa0Nonetheless, it’s important to note that the issuance of new ETH tokens dilutes the holdings of existing ETH holders.According to Token Terminal, the difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders, essentially the Ethereum blockchain owners. This calculation allows for the determination of Ethereum’s profitability on a day-to-day basis.Reduced Transaction Costs Drive $3.3 Billion GrowthIn addition to the overhauled revenue model implemented by the Ethereum blockchain, the launch of the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem at the end of the first quarter of 2024 brought significant changes, including the introduction of a revolutionary data storage system called blobs.\\xa0This upgrade has reduced congestion on the Ethereum network and significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum (ABR), Polygon (MATIC), and Coinbase’s Base.\\xa0Implementing the Dencun upgrade, alongside the adoption of blobs and Layer 2 networks, has significantly impacted Ethereum’s revenue.\\xa0According to Token Terminal data, the blockchain’s revenue has witnessed an 18% annualized increase, amounting to an impressive $3.3 billion. These revenue gains can be attributed to reduced transaction costs, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for users and developers.Despite the positive revenue growth, it is essential to acknowledge the impact of market corrections and dampened investor interest in the second quarter of 2024.\\xa0Over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s revenue has declined by over 52%. This downturn can be attributed to the broader market dynamics and the temporary decrease in investor enthusiasm.\\xa0Examining the data over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s market cap (fully diluted) has decreased by 15.2% to $358.47 billion. Similarly, the circulating market cap has declined by 15.2% to reach the same value.\\xa0Additionally, the token trading volume over the past 30 days has declined 18.6%, totaling $586.14 billion.\\xa0ETH is trading at $3,042, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. It remains to be seen whether these changes and the reduction in fees will have the same effect in the second quarter of the year, and how this, coupled with a potential increase in trading volume, can push the ETH price to higher levels.\\xa0Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\\xa0',\n",

Those were at $0.4850, $0.46 and $0.43, with bears likely to eye $0.40 next.That target could well get hit is Bitcoin succumbs to a post-halving sell-the-fact reaction, and macro headwinds keep building.The XRP price’s near-term technical outlook is ugly. Source: TradingViewXRP Alternative to Consider – 5thScape (5SCAPE) XRP’s near-term technical outlook is ugly. The token may well continue to keep pace with its better-performing rivals for the remainder of 2024.After all, Bitcoin sits at the forefront of global adoption in wake of recent US spot ETF approvals. ETH, while still facing regulatory risk, is a much more dynamic chain and remains the major home of DeFi.Investors looking to take their first steps into the crypto market would likely do better choosing either of these two.Alternatively, for more risk-tolerant investors looking to secure higher gains, a good strategy to consider is presale investing.Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fundraising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token.These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors.Of course, presale investing is very risky too.

Surpassing previous highs, this data indicates a notable shift towards long-term holding strategies among investors.Defined by specific criteria, including balances exceeding 10 BTC, no outgoing transactions, and exclusion of exchange or miner-associated accounts, these BTC accumulation addresses suggest a strategic pivot towards long-term holding despite market fluctuations.The surge in accumulation signals enduring confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, positioning it for a re-accumulation phase in the coming months after halving.BTC Accumulation and Post-Halving Predictions Notably, crypto analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ proposes that Bitcoin’s current correction phase may soon give way to a re-accumulation period post-halving. Historical patterns suggest that a BTC accumulation phase often leads to a period of price consolidation following halving events. 3 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving1.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could trade within the high $50k range until around October, reflecting a consolidation phase before potential upward momentum.Bitcoin Price Analysis and Resistance Levels Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading slightly below $64,000, marking a marginal increase of 4.3% within the past 24 hours.Jason Pizzino, a renowned crypto analyst, has as well, identifying key resistance levels at $67,000, $69,000, and $71,000. He emphasizes the importance of a BTC accumulation and consolidation above $67,000 for sustained bullish momentum.However, Pizzino also warns of potential downside risks if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above the $59,000 to $60,000 range, potentially leading to a correction towards the low to mid $50,000 range or even lower.Pizzino uses historical data to contextualize current market dynamics, drawing parallels to past halving events and aiding investor decision-making. His analysis echoes Rekt Capital’s observations regarding the potential BTC accumulation and price fluctuations following halvings.Recent data also indicates substantial capital outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, notably Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), contributing to the cryptocurrency’s decline.Bitcoin miners’ continuous selling before and after the halving event exerts additional downward pressure on the market.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Consensys Exec: ‘It Can Be Said With Confidence That the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum’',\n",
       "  'description': ' should be classified as a security. This investigation has sparked concerns among industry players, particularly Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Bill Hughes, Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters at Consensys, shared his insights on the matter during a recent interview he gave to CoinDesk.The Ethereum ecosystem is facing a critical moment as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigates whether Ether Hughes emphasized that Consensys is committed to decentralization and has been working to spin out projects and hand them over to the community. He highlighted MetaMask, a popular non-custodial wallet, as an example of this approach. However, Hughes noted that decentralizing MetaMask further might involve tokenization, which could raise regulatory questions. He emphasized that Consensys is dedicated to walking the walk, not just talking the talk, when it comes to decentralization.Regarding the SEC’s investigation, Hughes believes it’s unlikely that the agency is building a case specifically against the Ethereum Foundation. Instead, he thinks the SEC might be exploring whether ETH should be classified as a security, potentially using third-party cases to make their point. Hughes noted that the SEC’s approval of Ethereum-based futures ETFs in October 2023 implied that ETH was not considered a security at the time, making their current investigation puzzling. He suspects that the SEC may be changing its stance on ETH, which could have significant implications for the Ethereum ecosystem.Hughes also expressed skepticism about Prometheum, a special purpose broker-dealer that has been granted a license to operate without requiring formal SEC approval. He suspects that Prometheum’s declaration that ETH is a security might be a tactical move to influence the SEC’s stance without requiring formal approval. Hughes believes this could be an example of the SEC “picking winners” and favoring certain companies over others. He questions the lack of transparency and clarity in the SEC’s approach, which could lead to confusion and uncertainty in the industry.The conversation also touched on the recent news that Uniswap received a Wells notice, indicating an impending lawsuit from the SEC. Hughes believes this might be the start of a new front in the SEC’s war against crypto and that other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) might be next on their radar. He emphasized the need for clear guidance from regulators and the importance of community involvement in shaping the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. Featured Image via Pixabay',\n",

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin Cash (BCH) faces dimming enthusiasm as the price of the popular payments-focused Bitcoin fork dipped 20% over the last seven days to trade at $484 as of this writing.\\xa0Like the rest of the market, BCH appears to be tracking market leader Bitcoin, which fell 9% over the last week to trade for around $63,650, at the time of writing.Growing turmoil in the Middle East after an Iranian on Israel last weekend prompted the sell-off, which has now slowed down.\\xa0The two Bitcoins are now in the green again after the last 24 hours added 5% and 7% to BTC and BCH respectively.Investors are stocking up ahead of Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving on Saturday. That’s the day when a software update will halve BTC mining rewards.History suggests we’re on the cusp of a bull run. The previous three halvings have all increased the price of the original cryptocurrency as the halved supply struggled to meet consistent demand. There are some fears, however, that this year the halving may have already been priced in.However, BCH’s price chart for the last three months tells a very different story to its namesake.At the beginning of March, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies began a rally that peaked by the middle.BCH initially rallied in step with them, but the momentum fell by March 3.On the other end of the chart, BCH rallied from late March to early April, independent of Bitcoin, which remained stagnant over the same period.How Bitcoin Cash Differs to Bitcoin Back in 2017, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called\\xa0Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91.\\xa0The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which allow the network to process more transactions per second.However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations.The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. The original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value.Betting on Bitcoin? Why Not Gamble With Megadice? The uncertainty around Bitcoin’s halving underscores the volatility of crypto in general. It is still very much a bet, although early projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are a safer bet than others.Still, the crypto world abounds with plenty of useful applications that hint at a glowing and prosperous future. One such application is the world of GambleFi.A new ICO for Solana GameFi token Mega Dice (DICE) started this week and it has already raised over $300,000.DICE is the native token for Mega Dice’s Telegram-based crypto casino, with certain games requiring the token to play. It can also be used for staking casino cashback, airdrop prizes, and special NFT benefits.Curious? Prepare for Solana’s hottest new casino and Buy DICE Now',\n",

       "  'description': \"Popular Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) posted seven-day depreciation of as much as 50% in 24 hours by the morning of Thursday, April 18, according to by CoinGecko, although its intraweek losses have since slowed to about 31% as of this writing.Among meme coins, WIF took some of the heaviest losses amidst a market-wide downturn that has shaved double digit percentages off virtually every leading cryptocurrency in the last week.Leading meme coins fell by comparable amounts this week: sector leader Dogecoin (DOGE) lost 25%, Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 19.5%, PEPE shed 28%, FLOKI crashed 30% and BONK is down hardest (35%) among the 10 largest funny tokens by market cap.Bitcoin (BTC) led the losses with a 12% drop over the week and trades at just under $62k. The original cryptocurrency was buffeted by a stormy news cycle that began last weekend when Iran Israel in retaliation for a strike in Syria that killed Iranian soldiers.Additionally, volatility has increased a little ahead of Saturday’s Bitcoin halving event, a software update that will halve BTC mining rewards.The halving effectively chokes the new supply of Bitcoin and has many analysts suggesting an imminent bull run as the supply struggles to keep up with fresh institutional demand from the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January.Substantial Bitcoin price drops typically signal a market-wide dip.

That’s also evident when looking at futures market.As per , the funding rate paid by traders taking out leveraged Bitcoin long positions recently dipped to multi-month lows. (i.e. the USD value of outstanding leveraged futures positions) has also declined substantially from recent highs.A less frothy market suggests a more stable foundation from which the Bitcoin price can stage a rebound. That could explain the strength of Thursday’s rally, which has likely caught some off guard.With many altcoins well down from recent highs but the market now rebounding, the potential is there for quick gains.Here are some strong-performing altcoins on Thursday that could be the best crypto to buy now.Best Crypto to Buy NowInjective (INJ)Decentralized trading protocol\\xa0Injective (INJ)\\xa0is gaining momentum as the market rebounds and is eyeing a retest of $30 resistance.As per , the token was last up around 14% in 24 hours, with a $2.7 billion market cap.Stake and Chill 🫡 — Injective 🥷 (@injective) No specific catalyst appears behind the cryptos outperformance. However, news that the number of staked INJ tokens continues to rise is a good sign for the protocol.Its modest valuation suggests there remains plenty of room for the crypto to 5 or 10x from here.

The token is still down around 40% from its yearly highs at $6.50, having been battered since late March.But AKT is looking to break out of its recent downtrend. A break above the 21DMA at $4.20 could open the door to a pop higher to resistance-turned-support at $5.0.As AKT eyes a retest of this key level, it could be the best crypto to buy now.

Indeed, altcoin investing can be very profitable if investors can reliably find undervalued projects and time the market well.However, attempting to time the market comes with a lot of risks, given the high level of volatility in the altcoin market.An alternative strategy that carries less risks relating to market volatility is investing in crypto presales or ICOs.Up-and-coming web3 projects often conduct fund raising rounds to pay for early developments via the sale of their native token.These tokens are normally sold at a very cheap valuation to attract intrepid investors.Of course, presale investing is very risky too. A project may fail to deliver on its promises and roadmap, leaving investors out of pocket.But if a project gains traction, presale investors frequently find themselves sat on 10x or more gains.Here are some of the top presales being watched by analysts at Cryptonews.19 Best Crypto Presale Projects for April 2024',\n",

After suffering over the past week, DOGE is showing increasing signs of a recovery, with its indicators bottoming out and beginning to rise again.Most notably, DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) has jumped from 30 earlier this morning to just over 50 now, and it looks like it should continue for a while yet.Source: TradingViewAt the same time, the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has flattened out after a period of consistent declines, indicating that it had entered an oversold position and is now ready to rise again.We haven’t seen a pronounced spike in trading volume just yet, but with the coin now rising vigorously more buyers could soon follow.It’s likely that DOGE had fallen by so much that investors and traders could no longer pass on the opportunity to buy it at a discount.It’s also possible that today could be the beginning of a pre-Bitcoin halving rally, although some analysts have warned that financial pressure on miners could force a damaging selloff.However, given that the market has declined markedly over the past week, such a selloff may have already happened.This means that the market is now ready to recover while bringing the Dogecoin price along for the ride.Bitcoin's halving and Doge day colliding in 2 days! Which dog coin is going to SKYROCKET? 🐶🚀 — Moontok 月兔 🐇 (@MoontokOfficial) As for Dogecoin itself, the Bitcoin halving is set to take place on April 20, which is also Dogecoin Day.As such, we could see DOGE outperform the market a little, especially if it continues to receive plugs from Elon Musk, who recently tweeted about the coin.And if X ever integrates DOGE once it introduces digital payments on its platform, then the Dogecoin price could skyrocket.For now, traders can expect it to reach $0.2 in the next few weeks and $0.4 by the summer.New Presale Tokens May Outperform Bigger Coins Because DOGE’s performance may be a little too steady for some, they may prefer to invest in newer tokens, especially presale coins that can generate lots of momentum as they prepare to list.One exciting presale coin available at the moment is DICE, .Mega Dice is one of the most trusted online casinos in crypto, with its website offering over 4,500 games to play and bet on, from casino classic to sports betting.Capitalizing on its extraordinary growth since launching last year, Mega Dice is now launching the Solana-based DICE.🚀 is landing on Solana! 🎲 Get ready for exclusive benefits, retroactively and with every wager. 🌟 The ultimate casino token experience is coming.

SHIB’s move over the past hour has improved the complexion of its price chart, with its indicators beginning to show signs that the recent downturn is ending.For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has bounced from 40 earlier this morning to 60 today, and its rise is so steep that it looks like it could hit 70, if not higher.Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, SHIB’s 30-day average (orange) has turned ever so slightly upwards, and given that it has been well underneath the 200-day (blue) for several days now, it’s certainly looking like it should rise once again.It will, therefore, be interesting to see if SHIB can break through its resistance level (red), with the $0.00002365 mark also being an important resistance.It’s also interesting to note that the coin’s resistance and support (green) levels have formed a pennant, implying that the coin is due to make a big move very soon.Of course, the jump of the last hour could certainly be just this very move.🚨 692,400,000,000 (19,260,837 USD) transferred from to unknown wallet— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) In terms of things that could extend or curtail the current rally, the market is looking forward to the next Bitcoin halving, which will take place on Saturday.It seems clear that the halving has led to some miners selling their stores of BTC, given that they will face financial pressures as a result of their income receiving a 50% cut.However, it’s possible that the initial shock of this will give way to the more positive narrative that tends to accompany the Bitcoin halving.This means more bullishness across the board, with the Shiba Inu price likely to benefit as much as many other alts.It could reach $0.000040 by the summer, before reaching Q4 2024 at around $0.00010.Newer Meme Tokens Could Be More Profitable It’s worth noting that since SHIB has become so well-established in recent months and years, it may not experience the kind of wild rallies that characterized its early years.For this reason, traders may be better off devoting some of their portfolios to newer meme tokens, which can often rally disproportionately.And one of the most promising new meme coins right now is Slothana (SLOTH), a Solana-based coin that has raised more than $10 million in its presale.🚀 Hold onto your branches, Slothana faithful! 🌿 We're gearing up to drop some major news: the official launch date is on the horizon! ⏰ Get ready to mark your calendars and set your alarms, because a countdown timer will soon grace our site. Let the hype for the Slothana…— Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) Interestingly, there’s speculation that Slothana is associated with the same team that launched the successful Smog (SMOG) token, which rallied strongly when it was listed earlier in the year.SLOTHANA could, therefore, do something very similar, with its presale total suggesting that it already has plenty of support.In fact, it already boasts a healthy and growing community, with .The market is, therefore, increasingly expecting SLOTHANA to do good things once it lists, and with Solana-based meme tokens proving very big over the past six months, it’s certainly launching at the right time.It also helps that it has chosen a fairly distinctive meme in the humble sloth, which provides a playful representation of the desire of many retail traders to escape the typical 9-5.Its presale will end in 11 days, although newcomers can still join by heading over to the Slothana website.They can buy SLOTH at a rate of 1 SOL for 10,000 SLOTH, which works out at around $0.019393 per coin.Tokens will then be airdropped to investors once the sale ends, at which point Slothana will list on trading platforms and potentially moon.Visit Slothana Now\",\n",

With the dollar’s rise linked to paused rate cuts enhancing its appeal, Bitcoin faces an opposite effect—diminished attraction due to the anticipated long-term high rates.This positions Bitcoin at a precarious juncture, especially as the market braces for the April 20 halving, expected to slash mining rewards.This event and the dollar’s strength may heavily influence upcoming Bitcoin price prediction, pressing investors to closely monitor both market reactions and economic indicators.Bitcoin Declines as Dollar Strengthens Amid Rate Cut Pauses As the US dollar experiences its strongest five-day surge in 14 months, Bitcoin has seen a notable decline, falling 9% to $63,936. This drop is influenced by the likelihood of prolonged high interest rates, which tend to reduce the appeal of riskier assets such as Bitcoin.The inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the dollar typically sees Bitcoin gain popularity when the dollar weakens.

According to reports from\\xa0Spot on Chain, the individual in question has sold 2,000 ETH for six million USDC, a transaction of considerable magnitude.This event is particularly noteworthy due to the historical context of the whale's involvement with Ethereum.

Its 24 hour trading is up 8% to stand at $42.2 billion.The crypto decline has resulted in long and short position liquidations worth over $241 million in the last 24 hours. However, the single largest liquidation order recorded by the tracker happened on the crypto exchange OKX of ETH-USD-SWAP valued at $5.40 million.Data shows that 75% of the total liquidation of $244.43 million turns out to be long bets. The long position liquidations amount stands at $184.10 million. However, around $60 million of liquidation comes from short bets placed by the traders.This suggests the traders were expecting the ongoing correction to end soon, meanwhile, the crypto market printed red indexes all around.

       "  'description': 'Bloomberg ETF Analyst Rebecca Sin has shed light on the potential challenges and prospects facing the newly approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong. According to Sin, mainland Chinese investors are likely to face significant barriers when it comes to accessing these funds due to existing restrictions on investing in virtual assets.Despite the possibility of using the $50,000 remittance quota for retail investors, it remains an underutilized avenue for such investments. Furthermore, she says the prospects for institutional investors using the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) quota appear dim, as approvals for virtual asset ETFs under this scheme are not expected.The cost of managing these new ETFs is also a key consideration, with anticipated management fees ranging between 1-2%. This is comparable to existing products in the market, such as CSOP’s Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066 HK) and Ether Futures ETF (3068 HK), which levy a management fee of 2% alongside an estimated 2% in additional charges.Sin also projects that the new spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs could potentially amass up to $1 billion in assets under management (which is a lot less than the $25 billion predicted by Matrixport). However, achieving this milestone is contingent upon the pace of improvements in both infrastructure and the broader ecosystem surrounding these products. For context, the Asia-Pacific region’s Bitcoin ETFs, which are split between three funds in Hong Kong and two in Australia, currently manage a total of $250 million in assets.The introduction of these ETFs marks a significant development for the issuers involved—Bosera Asset Management, Harvest International, and ChinaAMC. Notably, these firms will be the pioneers in launching spot Bitcoin and Ether products in the region. Bosera, for instance, currently manages six ETFs with $40 million in assets under management, while ChinaAMC boasts 15 ETFs with a substantial $3.6 billion, and Harvest manages three ETFs totaling $10 million. These figures are set against the backdrop of Hong Kong’s entire ETF market, which holds approximately $51 billion in assets under management. Now for some good news re HK, our asset estimate is now $1b in first two years (which is healthy IMO but still nowhere near the $25b that some have said) but a lot depends on infrastructure improvement.

       "  'title': 'The Lightning Network Is Beneficial For Small-Scale Bitcoin Miners Pre-Halving',\n",
       "  'description': 'Momentum around Bitcoin (BTC) continues to build as the Halving Event quickly approaches, and the Lightning Network is playing an important role in supporting small-scale miners. Bitcoin miners, in particular, have been paying close attention to how this year’s halving may impact operations.For instance, as mining rewards decrease due to the halving, miner efficiency has become more important. As a result, .\\xa0The halving will also impact small-scale miners. Jesse Shrader, Co-Founder and CEO of Amboss, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin mining pools, particularly, will receive fewer Bitcoins due to the halving. Shrader added that rising transaction fees will create additional challenges.\\xa0“In order to provide miner payouts, third-party mining pools will have to pay increasing transaction fees,” said Shrader. “This means that all miners participating in pools will likely have to reach at least 0.01 BTC before receiving a payout.”The Lightning Network Helps Small-Scale Miners Shrader believes miners supporting the Lightning Network (LN) can combat the abovementioned challenges. The LN is a layer-2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. It leverages payment channels, enabling peer-to-peer payments between two parties outside of the expensive main Bitcoin blockchain. Once established, LN channels allow transacting parties to send an unlimited number of nearly instant transactions, which are also much less expensive than transactions made on the Bitcoin blockchain.“Mining pools will need to use LN for payouts as this allows for a reusable payment infrastructure, rather than having mining pools pay multiple, separate transactions for payouts,” said Shrader.4/7 The saw an adoption spike, with 13.5% of Bitcoin payments made on it in March.This shows users prefer a faster and more efficient way to spend BTC. — CoinGate (@CoinGatecom) While LN was launched in 2018 and is primarily used by hobbyists, Shrader noted that businesses increasingly leverage the network.\\xa0“Amboss is a discoverability platform for The Lightning Network that helps establish the needed peer-to-peer channels,” he said. “We have also been doing data analytics on LN and have noticed that the customer base has shifted more towards businesses.”Small-Scale Miners Add Support For Lighting Network Pre-Halving Indeed, it appears logical for small-scale mining pools to use LN for payouts.\\xa0“NiceHash, for example, has already been using LN for this,” said Shrader.\\xa0What’s better than getting paid out every 4 hours in ? Getting your mining payouts on the ! NiceHash launches the world’s first automated mining Lightning payouts! As if you needed another reason to mine with us… 😉 … — NiceHash (@NiceHashMining) , NiceHash began supporting manual LN withdrawals in 2020.\\xa0The post explains that NiceHash miners can receive mining payouts directly to an external Lightning Network Address. This enables instant mining payouts every 4 hours without Bitcoin blockchain transaction fees.\\xa0, miners who do not use the Lightning Network (LN) are subject to a transaction fee of 0.0001 BTC or higher, depending on the current Bitcoin blockchain conditions.This is particularly important to consider as the Bitcoin Halving Event approaches, .More Small-Scale Miners Implement LN\\xa0 Kristian Csepcsar, CMO at Braiins – a leading mining pool in the Bitcoin industry – told Cryptonews that The Lighting Network was also just implemented into the Braiins Pool platform.\\xa0Introducing Lightning payouts ⚡️We are excited to be the first mining pool using the Lightning Network.Our miners can now instantly receive rewards with no minimums or fees. — Braiins (@BraiinsMining) “As of today, the Braiins Pool platform supports LN,” said Csepsar. “Braiins Pool is the longest running mining pool since 2010 with over 1.3 million BTC mined.”Support for LN on Braiins is an important development, as Csepsar noted that many small miners, hobby miners, or miners using home heating divides and mini miners will benefit.\\xa0“All of these use cases produce very tiny amounts of rewards, so it is difficult to payout these miners on-chain,” he said. “For these reasons, we have launched LN payouts, so that even a home miner using a mining device for heat production for a few hours a day can pay out a few thousands sats every day at no cost.”\\xa0Csepsar added, “It is recommended for miners not to reuse one payout on-chain address for their numerous transactions, but most miners do not follow this recommendation.” He believes that LN solves this issue while significantly improving users’ privacy.Lighting Network Gains Momentum Jay Beddict, VP of Research at Foundry, told Cryptonews that LN would be compelling for small-scale miners after the upcoming halving event.\\xa0“It may be prudent for interested miners to open Lightning channels pre-halving, as fees may become highly volatile in the run-up to and following the halving,” said Beddict. “But even so, many small miners do not earn enough daily to meet minimal withdrawal thresholds on pools. Lightning offers a way to minimize custodial risk without having to earn more to meet on-chain thresholds.”Given this, Beddict shared that Foundry – which is best known for operating the Bitcoin mining pool “Foundry USA Pool” – is comfortable with LN’s operation and usage.\\xa0Alex Busarov, Founder and CEO at Heatbit, also told Cryptonews that Heatbit would soon be integrating LN to handle its miner payouts. Heatbit provides Bitcoin-mining home devices that enable users to heat their spaces through mining, instead of using traditional heating methods.“The Lightning Network is particularly beneficial for our home-based users who might earn smaller mining rewards,” said Beddict. “This way we reduce transaction fees and speed up the transfer process, making it feasible to pay out even the smallest rewards promptly.”Challenges May Hamper Lightning Network’s Adoption While it’s notable that the Lightning Network is being used by more small-scale miners, challenges remain.\\xa0Austin Mitchell, Co-founder and CEO at energy company Synota, told Cryptonews that the biggest challenge with using The Lightning Network is adoption.\\xa0“The Lightning Network is really only useful if miners have counterparties to pay on the network,” said Mitchell.\\xa0Fortunately, the Lightning Network appears to be growing. According to a recent report from Arcane Research, more than 80 million users now have access to LN, a huge increase compared to LN’s 100,000 users in 2022.\\xa0Additionally, Mitchell explained that Synota intends to drive LN adoption by enabling energy suppliers, hosting and infrastructure services companies, and brokers to receive payments via LN.\\xa0“Synota is solving the payee adoption problem by connecting with different payment rails to automate the movement of funds based off the enforcement of contracts in a non-custodial manner,” he said. “One of those payment rails Synota connects to is the Lightning Network, which allows Bitcoin miners to pay for their energy in Bitcoin.”Although this may help with LN growth, Beddict explained that operating on LN properly still requires maintaining a complex hot wallet infrastructure. “This may create complexity beyond that of simply receiving payouts on-chain,” Beddict noted.Yet Csepcsar remains optimistic, noting that help from experts has allowed Braiins to implement LN payouts successfully.“We are very early in Bitcoin and with LN even more,” he said. “The network can be a challenging new tech with obstacles like balancing the channels, etc. That’s why we have brought experts on board to make this happen.”',\n",

       "  'description': 'Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution by total value locked (TVL), is taking steps towards decentralization. In an update on April 16, Offchain Labs–Arbitrum developers–said they have deployed the permissionless version of their fraud proofs, dubbed Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD), to testnet.Ethereum Layer-2s Are Popular, But There Is A Big ProblemEthereum layer-2 solutions have been gaining prominence over the years. According to L2Beat data on April 17, these platforms control over $37 billion of assets. Protocol developers and users can send transactions cheaply through Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and other alternatives.\\xa0However, while they are popular and command billions in TVL, most of these platforms’ fraud proofs are being developed. Typically, when users transact all chains, all transactions must be confirmed by a web of miners or validators, depending on the consensus mechanism.\\xa0This differs in layer-2 options, which must reroute transactions and process them off-chain. There is no way of proving whether queued transactions are valid before being batched and confirmed on-chain.The fraud proofs, such as those presented by Arbitrum and other optimistic rollup solutions, are designed to address a critical issue in layer-2 solutions. Specifically, once live and integrated into Arbitrum, BOLD will serve as a safety net, ensuring the validity of transactions processed off-chain. This mechanism is crucial in maintaining the integrity of transactions while enabling efficient off-chain processing.In compliance with blockchain principles, BOLD will be decentralized. As such, the community will run nodes, which differs from the current setup. As it is, transaction validation in Arbitrum is centralized, and only a few validators are tasked with this.Arbitrum Deploys BOLD In Testnet, ARB Prices FallingWith BOLD in the testnet, Arbitrum is opening up its rails so that anyone can participate in network security and validate withdrawals back to Ethereum. This move will be critical in building a more decentralized ecosystem and making the platform more robust.Arbitrum becomes the first Ethereum layer-2 to launch its fraud proofs in testnet. In a post on X, Ryan Watts of Optimism also\\xa0notified\\xa0the community that plans are underway to create a decentralized fraud-proof system for the second-most largest layer-2 by TVL.Even with this major milestone, ARB prices are stable and under pressure.

       "  'description': 'Shiba Inu has recently flashed a warning indicator: its 21-day EMA has dipped below the 50-day EMA. Usually, that cross is not considered a type of signal that would hint at serious problems for assets. However, it clearly shows that the momentum on the Shiba Inu market is plummeting. Chart by TradingViewFor now, SHIB is moving around $0.000022, seemingly taking a breather and consolidating. What happens next is largely tied to the mood of the crypto market in general. The upcoming \"halving\" event has yet to show its full effect. If it turns positive and money starts flowing back into cryptocurrencies, meme coins like SHIB could see renewed interest.However, on its own, SHIB does not have a strong case for a bullish run. The market has not given it much love independently, and it will need a boost from the general market to start moving up again.If SHIB were to start climbing, it would first meet resistance near the $0.0000276 level. On the flip side, if it continues to drop, the next significant support lies around $0.00001635 (200 EMA). These are key levels to watch, as they could determine SHIB\\'s direction in the coming days.The path forward for SHIB is not clear cut. While some hope the halving effect will kick in and push assets like SHIB upward, Shiba Inu still does not provide any fundamental value to investors and only rises based on the speculative nature of the crypto market.Ethereum retraceEthereum\\'s mixed performance raises a lot of questions, but the most important one right now: is it still in an uptrend? Recent patterns in Ethereum\\'s price movements suggest it might be setting up for a recovery.On the chart, Ethereum is drawing \"higher lows\" — each dip in price is not going as low as the last one, which could signal strength and a potential upward trend. Additionally, there is consistent trading volume, hinting at an interest in buying and selling the cryptocurrency.The RSI is nearing \"oversold\" territory. This often means that the asset could be due for a price increase as it suggests it has been sold too much.Technically, all these signs point toward a possible uptrend for Ethereum. However, technical analysis is not the most reliable analysis method. For a real recovery, there needs to be a fundamental reason behind it — a shift in market conditions or investor sentiment that drives buying activity.The market is still reeling from the recent \"halving\" event, which, contrary to expectations, has not injected the anticipated buying power. Some investors\\' patience is wearing thin as hope for a quick rebound decreases.Ethereum\\'s immediate resistance lies around $3,500, with the recent drop finding support near $2,700. If Ethereum can push past the resistance, it might reclaim higher prices. But if the market does not find a fundamental reason to buy in, Ethereum could test the $2,708 support level once more.Depressing state of XRPXRP has surely seen better days. Since the beginning of the year, while other cryptocurrencies were enjoying a bull run, XRP\\'s value has actually dropped by about 15%, making it one of the weaker players on the market.Its current price is moving at major support levels, suggesting it might be undervalued. The big question is whether this is the reset XRP needed to bounce back, or if it will continue to lag behind its peers. Right now, with the price sitting near the $0.45 mark, which has historically acted as a solid floor for the asset, it feels like XRP is at a crossroads.Of course, there is always a possibility of a reversal. If we take a look at the chart, we can spot potential turning points for XRP. If the currency can collect enough buying support and start to rise, the immediate resistance to beat would be around $0.58. On the downside, if the price breaks below the current support at $0.45, it could plummet further.XRP\\'s price is cheap, and cheapness often does not correlate with value. It is going to take a solid shift in sentiment or resolution of its legal issues to bring buyers back. Until then, choosing XRP as your go-to asset might end up being problematic for your portfolio.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Are Altcoins Cooling Off? Analyst Weighs In On This Cycle’s Market',\n",
       "  'description': 'Many investors expressed worries about the crypto market corrections during this cycle. Bitcoin’s price drop has dragged altcoins with them, and, as a result, a more pessimistic sentiment has started to brew among some sectors of the crypto community.Analysts and traders have reassured investors that the market fluctuations are a normal part of the journey. Some urge the community to look at the bigger picture, as altcoins remain above levels not seen in years.Renowned crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the matter, exploring some of the reasons and differences that make this bull cycle different from the 2020s.Time For An Altcoins Cool-Off?In an X post, Altcoin Sherpa asserted that there’s a high possibility “that altcoins are done for the next 1-4 months.” The analyst considers that, right now, most of the market needs “time to chill out and consolidate after such a big run.”Despite recently falling below the $1 trillion market capitalization, altcoins have performed remarkably in the last few months. In 2024, cryptocurrencies’ market cap, excluding Bitcoin’s, has increased by 22.79%, according to TradingView data.Altcoins market cap has also considerably surged in longer timeframes, with a 91.31% and 52.46% jump in the last six months and the past year. This “big run,” as Sherpa called it, sits the cryptocurrency market at levels like those seen in 2022.However, what worries the crypto analyst is, despite the overall performance, “many alts didn’t even run that hard over the last few months.” He illustrated his point with Chainlink’s native token, LINK.Despite the +500 days of accumulation, LINK investors only got 3-4x gains depending on when they go in. Now, the token’s price is “strongly pulling back.” Expectations for altcoins during this cycle seemingly play a significant role in the current sentiment.As one X user pointed out, LINK was anticipated to be one of the biggest winners of this cycle, Sherpa replied that he “expected more lol.” The user playfully commented, “No dino coins and new and shiny coins are the better bet.” How Did The Market Change? The previous comment highlights what appears to be a significant difference between this bull run and the 2020s. Choosing your bag has become more difficult since the market has expanded significantly.Sherpa considers that “now more than ever, it is super important to choose the altcoins that are going to run hard.” In 2020, the massive altseason made “everything go up consecutively.”This time, the liquidity is more fragmented, and “only a few sectors are pumping.” The AI and memes sectors have been the hottest topic in 2024, and layer-1 (L1) tokens, like SEI, have also performed well. “Everything else? Not great,” remarked Sherpa.The massive number of tokens, both newly launched and old ones, are finding it more difficult to “capture mindshare/attention.”Regarding retail investors, the analyst is not surprised that the default choice is memecoins instead of “trying to learn about some DeFi veRewards type of stuff. Or Oracle or L1s or modular or anything else.”The analyst suggested investors “move to real value” like ETH and SOL. He also considers that big token launches, with significant money behind them, “have some real value.” These coins, as stated in the post, have the potential to “do very well” once Bitcoin stabilizes.Sherpa’s market analysis closes with a “pretty bearish” outlook for the following months. The growing difficulty in keeping user attention and “for people to become strong users/community members” for many projects has made the market a different playground.Ultimately, the analyst pointed out that “portfolio rebalances are necessary” and said\\xa0he still believes this run is not over.',\n",

First and foremost, a meme coin’s longevity is determined by its community, and Floki boasts close to 600,000 followers on Twitter.Additionally, the Floki community and its developers are making efforts to transform FLOKI into more than just a meme coin.

Going short on meme coins like Floki right now might have a higher probability of delivering returns, however.But anyone holding onto a short position risks being blown up at any point should the hype suddenly return.With its market cap back at a modest $1.3 billion, Floki could easily still post 10x or more gains in this bull market.Floki Alternative to Consider Some consider meme coins to be high-risk investments due to their lack of inherent value, while others view them as a potential pathway to big gains.These investors might want to look into presale investing.

According to data from Farside Investors, Bitcoin’s recent price action has resulted in net outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on April 12 and 15. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said in a X post that demand for Bitcoin ETFs has “stagnated for 4 weeks.”Bitcoin However, a comforting factor for the bulls is that the whales have not panicked and are not selling on weakness.

That may trap several aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. That enhances the prospects of a rally above $73,777. Ether price analysisEther (ETH) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,301) on April 15 and broke below the $3,056 support on April 16. pair may drop to $2,852. This is a crucial level for the bulls to defend because a break and close below it may accelerate selling. The pair may tumble to $2,717 and subsequently to $2,200.If the price maintains below $3,056, the Conversely, if the price rebounds off $2,852 with strength, it will signal solid buying at lower levels. The bulls will then make another attempt to clear the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may attempt a rally to $3,679.BNB price analysisAfter trading between the moving averages for three days, BNB (BNB) slipped below the 50-day simple moving average ($541) on April 17, signaling that bears have overpowered the bulls. pair will be vulnerable to fall to $460 and later to $400. pair could tumble to the strong support at $495, an important level to watch out for.

The pair could then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance of $635, where the bears will try to stall the up move.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) turned down from $156 on April 15 and reached the crucial support at $126. This suggests that every recovery attempt is being met with strong selling from the bears. pair may plummet to $100.The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative zone, signaling that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the $126 support cracks, the selling could intensify and the On the contrary, if the price turns up sharply from the current level, it will suggest solid demand at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $162. A break and close above this resistance will signal that the bulls are back in the game.XRP price analysisXRP’s (XRP) recovery fizzled out at $0.52 on April 15, indicating that the bears are keeping up the pressure and are selling on minor relief rallies.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.56) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that bears are in control. Sellers will have to sink the price below $0.46 to start the downward move to the vital support at $0.41. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $0.46 to $0.41 support zone.  pair may swing between $0.41 and $0.74 for a while longer.Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at $0.52 and again at the 20-day EMA.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.54) and the RSI in the oversold zone indicate that bears are in control.Buyers are likely to defend the $0.40 with vigor because if this support cracks, the selling could pick up, and the If the price bounces off $0.40, it will suggest demand at lower levels. The bulls will gain strength above $0.50. The pair could then rally to the 20-day EMA and thereafter to $0.62, where the bears may again pose a strong challenge.Avalanche price analysisAvalanche’s (AVAX) recovery could not even reach the breakdown level of $42, signaling a lack of aggressive buying by the bulls. pair could plummet to $20.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($43) and the RSI near the oversold territory indicate that bears are in charge. The support to watch on the downside is $29 and then $27. If this zone cracks, the selling could intensify and the The relief rally is likely to face strong selling at the downtrend line. A break and close above this resistance will be the first indication that the bulls are on a comeback.

That will complete a 100% retracement of the most recent leg of the rally.The bears are expected to take another shot at the $0.000017 level. If this support breaks down, the selling could accelerate and the On the contrary, a rise above the downtrend line will be the first indication that the bears are losing their grip.

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin Price PredictionAs Bitcoin trades at $61,577, down by approximately 2.50% with a $42 billion trading volume over the last 24 hours, market watchers are paying close attention.With a market cap of about $1.21 trillion, Bitcoin continues to lead on . This cryptocurrency, with 19,685,362 BTC in circulation nearing its max of 21 million, is poised at a critical juncture.The Bitcoin price prediction now hinges on upcoming market movements and technical indicators, closely monitored by investors and analysts alike.Riot Platforms and CleanSpark Poised for Growth Amid Bitcoin Halving, Says Bernstein Ahead of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, the “miner fear factor” is at an all-time high, driving investor focus towards Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK). Bernstein, in a recent research note, highlighted these companies as top picks, applauding their exceptional performance and leadership in self-mining hashrate.Despite Bitcoin mining stocks lagging behind Bitcoin’s price year-to-date, the halving—which will cut mining rewards by 50% and slow Bitcoin supply growth—is expected around April 19-20.This event historically precedes significant Bitcoin price increases, although this cycle saw early gains due to ETF approvals in January.Future Outlook: Bernstein anticipates a return to bullish trends post-halving as mining adjustments and resumed ETF inflows drive demand. They predict Bitcoin could reach $150K by 2025, supported by ongoing demand from wirehouses and registered investment advisors rolling out spot Bitcoin ETFs.Market Context: Recent ETF approvals spurred early 2024 Bitcoin price increases, but a recent 15% drop in Bitcoin’s price followed due to slower ETF inflows.Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD)‘s current pivot point sits at $64,566, serving as a key threshold for the day’s trading dynamics.

Strong support at $59,869, with potential dips to $57,135 & $54,359 if breached. 2-hr RSI at 32 suggests bearish trend. Watch for moves beyond $63,850 for trend shifts. — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) The technical indicators on the 2-hour chart suggest a bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32, indicating that Bitcoin is potentially oversold but still under pressure as the RSI remains below the midline of 50.This suggests continued bearish momentum in the short term. Additionally, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $63,850 acts as a resistance level, reinforcing the downward trend observed on the chart.Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: TradingviewThe current market setup shows Bitcoin navigating through a downward channel, with the $63,850 level aligning with both the 50 EMA and recent price actions to form a significant resistance zone.Conclusion: While Bitcoin remains bullish above its immediate support at $59,869, a breach below this mark could trigger a sharp selloff, potentially testing lower supports at $57,135 and $54,359.Unlock Cryptocurrency Rewards: Dive Into the 99Bitcoins Presale!  99Bitcoins, a pioneering digital education platform, is redefining cryptocurrency learning through its unique ‘learn-to-earn’ system.

While many in the industry expect applications for spot ether ETFs to be denied next month, there has been a growing consensus that the Securities and Exchange Commission will eventually approve the Ethereum-based investment vehicles.ETF era for crypto\"Whether we get approval in May or later, we\\'ve demonstrated that the launch of ETF\\'s lower cost and improved protections for investors looking to access this asset class; so I do think an Ethereum ETF is a question of when and not if,\" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, who also participated in the roundtable.Bitwise has also issued a spot bitcoin ETF on top of filing an application for a spot ether ETF.ProShares Head of Investment Strategy Simeon Hyman, also on the roundtable, echoed LaValle\\'s sentiments about the market eventually expanding to include other cryptocurrencies. \"I can\\'t imagine there won\\'t be another couple currencies that emerge sufficient of scale and size for all of us to participate.

The chart shows an… — Crypto 4 Light (@vladi4light) There are plenty of reasons for Bitcoin investors who are sitting on substantial paper gains to take profit.Here’s Where the Bitcoin Price is Headed Next Last weekend, Bitcoin’s technical outlook turned sour after it bearishly broke out of its recent pennant structure consolidation pattern.However, the bears’ first profit target has been hit now that it has hit $60,000 and tested its March lows.The key question now is whether Bitcoin can hold above its $60,000 support.All of the above-mentioned arguments—i.e., slowing ETF flows, growing macro headwinds, and potential post-halving sell pressure—suggest risks are tilted toward a near-term break into the $50,000s.However, the latest pullback in the Bitcoin price has flushed a lot of froth out of the market.As recently as March 28, the value of open leveraged futures positions (or open interest) was $36.31 billion. According to coinglass.com data, it was last 22% lower at $28.64 billion.The latest pullback has seen open interest in the futures market drop substantially.

Source: coinglass.com.A less frothy market suggests that the foundations are there for a more sustained price recovery.If fundamentals continue to deteriorate, a sustained breakdown into the $50,000s remains the most probable outcome, however.Once the $60,000 support zone goes, a swift drop back to the next major support level at $53,000 is likely.A break below $60,000 could see the Bitcoin price quickly dip to $53,000 support. Source: TradingView.Investors to Buy the Dip? However, once the BTC price drops back to these areas, we could see major investors stepping in to buy the dip.Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains highly positive. The narrative that it is “digital gold” continues to gain ground.Many major US brokerages and wirehouses are yet to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients, so access will continue to widen.US government deficit spending is likely to remain high in an election year. And the US election could see the US regulatory landscape swivel more pro-crypto.Meanwhile, the Fed is still expected to start cutting rates a little later than the markets hoped.Also, once post-halving miner sell pressure eases, the lower BTC issuance rate will start acting as more of a tailwind.On Saturday, the rate of BTC issuance to miners will drop 50% from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125.Bitcoin remains on course to hit and likely exceed $100,000 in the coming years.

       "  'description': 'The Ethereum price is currently undergoing a notable corrective movement, having corrected to approximately $2,845 in recent daysA month ago, BeInCrypto suggested that significant support levels were around $3,215 at the 50-day EMA and between $3,107 and $3,215 at key Fibonacci levels. This range presented a favorable opportunity for Ethereum to experience a bullish rebound.ETH Finds Support: Price Stabilizes at 0.382 Fib Level, Around $3,107In the monthly chart, Ethereum’s price remains positioned near the 0.382 Fibonacci support level. A potential bullish scenario entails a monthly close above this level, signaling positive momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, failure to maintain this support could lead to further downsides, with significant Fibonacci support of around $2,500.Despite the ongoing corrective movement, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines retain a bullish crossover while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers in neutral territory.Nonetheless, the MACD histogram shows early signs of a bearish downturn. Amidst a monthly decline of approximately 24%, Ethereum has retraced nearly 31% from its recent peak of around $4,095.Is a Bullish Rebound in Store for Ethereum?Last week, Ethereum managed to maintain its position above the 0.382 Fibonacci support level, holding steady at around $3,107. This trend has persisted into the current week.However, caution is warranted as the MACD lines on the weekly chart are on the verge of forming a bearish crossover. The MACD histogram has also exhibited a bearish trend over the past few weeks.Meanwhile, the RSI remains neutral, offering no clear direction. If Ethereum breaks below the current support, the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $2,442 is poised to provide additional support.Furthermore, the 50-week EMA at the Golden Ratio is another layer of support. Despite these potential bearish signals, it’s worth noting that the EMAs still exhibit a golden crossover, indicating a bullish trend in the medium term.Ethereum Remains in a Downward ChannelIn the daily chart, Ethereum is currently within a parallel descending channel. If ETH decides to move upwards, it will encounter significant resistance at the 50-day EMA, which aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci level around $3,324.Alternatively, should ETH continue its upward momentum, it will face substantial resistance at the channel’s upper boundary, near $3,650, corresponding to the golden ratio.The indicators present mixed signals on the daily chart. While the EMAs display a golden crossover, signaling a bullish trend in the short to medium term, the MACD lines have crossed bearishly.However, the MACD histogram has started to show bullish momentum today. The RSI remains indecisive, providing no clear signals at the moment.Death Cross Signals Potential Downturn on 4H ChartIn the 4-hour chart, Ethereum exhibits a bullish sentiment as indicated by the MACD lines, which are crossed upwards, and the MACD histogram, which shows a bullish trend. Concurrently, the RSI is situated in neutral territory.Nevertheless, the EMAs’ death cross formation suggests a short-term bearish trend.ETH vs. BTC: Ethereum Tests Resistance at 50-4H EMA, Near 0.049 BTCCompared to Bitcoin, Ethereum’s price is experiencing a downward trend, with significant support found near 0.043 BTC. Conversely, resistance is prominent at the 50-4H Exponential Moving Average, currently around 0.049 BTC, where the price faces rejection.The MACD histogram indicates a bearish trend with a downward tick, while the MACD lines are poised for a bearish crossover. Additionally, the Death Cross formed by the Exponential Moving Averages further confirms the short-term bearish trend.Given these indicators, Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin suggests a potential return to the golden ratio support at approximately 0.043 BTC in the short to medium term.',\n",

Importantly, many of these exist for valid use cases,However, there are also unproductive bots, including yield farming bots, that cause congested networks and high fees.Therefore, World ID is meant to help the new chain with this issue.Everybody will be able to submit transactions on this open and permissionless network, the team said. However, verified humans’ transactions will be prioritized for faster confirmation times.Maximum inclusivity, maximum privacy. — Worldcoin (@worldcoin) Therefore, the new chain seeks to address the issue of congested networks and high fees.It aims to do this by providing verified humans with “some” free gas as an allowance “for casual transactions” and priority blockspace over bots.This allowance should minimize users’ initial friction. It will initially be sponsored by the Worldcoin Foundation.However, “the protocol will seek to reach an equilibrium where gas for casual users is ultimately covered by fees from bots and power users.”Also, ETH will remain the native token, but users will be able to pay fees using WLD.Therefore, when verified humans claim their WLD grants every two weeks, they will be able to use it for apps immediately.Also, the team promises to enable developers to reach millions of real users globally with apps focused on real-world utility.‘Apps for Every-Day Life’ World Chain will not attempt to “cover every possible blockchain use case,” said the announcement.Instead, it seeks to be an ecosystem of decentralized financial and identity apps “focused on utility for everyday life.”Per the announcement, the project will accomplish this via World ID’s Sybil resistance. the team will build it around Worldcoin, stablecoins, payments, rewards, ramps, lending, swapping, and more.World Chain will be integrated with the Worldcoin protocol in order to speed up its growth and use World ID’s Proof of Personhood for sybil-resistant apps.Furthermore, the chain will be permissionless and open source. “Ultimately,” the community will own and govern it.Ethereum will secure the chain as a Layer-2, engineered for scalability alongside Additionally, World ID and WLD “will remain neutral public goods able to be used and deployed on networks beyond World Chain.”World App by the numbers — Worldcoin (@worldcoin) Meanwhile, Worldcoin launched in July 2023. So far, the team has recorded 10 million people in 160 countries who have created a World ID and a compatible wallet.These people used their wallets to perform 75 million transactions, they said.At the time of writing, WLD’s price has decreased 0.8% over the past 24 hours.Source: coingecko.com to CoinGecko, it currently trades at $4.95.It’s down 24% in a week and 46% in a month.It reached its all-time high of $11.74 on March 10, 2024, and has dropped nearly 60% since then.',\n",

Other leading meme coins posted similar 7-day depreciation, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which fell 16% and 18%, respectively, over the aforementioned period.\\xa0Meanwhile, market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also fell, but not as much as the meme coins. Bitcoin is down 8% over the week to trade at $63,458, with the bulk of its losses occurring over the weekend.\\xa0That’s because the market-wide crypto dump began on Friday, after Iran attacked Israel and created conditions of global uncertainty, causing people to exit riskier assets like Bitcoin.According to PEPE’s trading chart, the token has been finding support at its current price since Saturday. As with Bitcoin, this is when the bulk of PEPE’s 7-day losses occurred between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.Source: TradingViewAs with many leading coins, the month of March catalyzed a rally that culminated in mid-March with Pepe setting a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00001064. Today’s price represents a pullback of nearly 50%, although the losses appear to have stopped ahead of Bitcoin’s halving on Saturday.\\xa0Load Up On Meme Coins This 4/20 With PEPE and SLOTH The industry is holding out for a bull run after Bitcoin’s halving on April 20.It’s happened in the previous three halvings and analysts expect this time will be no different. That’s because in halving BTC mining rewards, the issuance of new Bitcoin gets cut in half. Where there’s a supply squeeze, prices rally.But meme coins have an edge on every other crypto category on Saturday because the halving coincidentally falls on 4/20, International Stoner day, another price driver for certain projects.🌿📜 And lo, Slothana, in its eternal wisdom and benevolence, hath decreed: 'Behold, there are but twelve days remaining until the dawn of a new era.' 🚀 Let us prepare our hearts and minds, for the age of Slothana draws near. May the gains and Lambos be bestowed upon us all.…— Slothana (@SlothanaCoin) Dog coin holders expect a pump too that day, because the Dogecoin community selected 4/20 to commemorate their favorite coin. However, the fate of PEPE holders on 4/20 is a bit harder to guess.That’s not the case for new Solana meme coin Slothana (SLOTH). From the clock on the wall to his baked red-eyes and contented smirk, Slothana is one of 4/20’s biggest fans.\\xa0In just three weeks, traders have poured well\\xa0over $10 million\\xa0into his ICO in a bid to try and recapture some of the early upside potential of recently profitable Solana meme coins like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk.Interested investors can join the SLOTH presale today by sending SOL to this address:\\xa0EnSawje2vQSQKtGbPYdXEuYKm2sHgeLKJTqCmrDErKEA\\xa0or using the contribution widget on the Slothana website.Yesterday, a countdown timer appeared on Slothana’s landing page.

       "  'description': \"According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale who accumulated a substantial amount of ETH at the market bottom in September 2022 has made a notable deposit of 5,000 ETH to popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Back in September 2022, when the Ethereum network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus, the whale took advantage of the opportunity to buy ETH at what was considered the market bottom. The timing seemed right as the price of Ethereum was nearly $1,567 per ETH, totaling a value of $151.42 million for the bulk purchase.According to Lookonchain, the ETH whale withdrew 96,638 ETH worth $151.42 million at the time from Coinbase at $1,567 from Sept. 3 to Sept. 7, 2022.The whale that bought $ETH at the bottom in Sept 2022 appears to be selling $ETH at a profit again.He deposited 5K $ETH to #Kraken 56 minutes ago.He withdrew 96,638 $ETH($151.42M at the time) from #Coinbase at $1,567 from Sept 3 to Sept 7, 2022.And he currently has 76,638… pic.twitter.com/5FR0TXRGF5— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 16, 2024Fast forward to now, and the same whale has transferred 5,000 ETH to Kraken, presumably to sell it at a profit. When whales deposit their tokens into exchanges, it typically suggests a potential sale, while withdrawals signal an intent to buy.At the time of the deposit, the price of Ethereum had risen, indicating a significant profit margin for the investor. The whale still has 76,638 ETH worth $233.56 million remaining, for a total profit of more than $153.7 million.The whale's action indicates that the perfect combination of timing and market sentiment can lead to significant returns. The wrong timing might lead to ultimate losses, which was the scenario of another ETH whale who saw significant losses as the ETH price dipped.Ethereum saw selling pressure at the start of the week after reaching highs of $3,281 on April 15. The drop persisted, with Ethereum falling for two consecutive days before slightly rebounding. At the time of writing, ETH was up 0.43% in the last 24 hours to $3,058.As reported, an ETH whale sold their 10,701 ETH stash worth $33 million, losing more than $4 million for the second time after going long on ETH. The first time, they lost almost $500,000.\",\n",

However, Railgun refuted these accusations in an X post responding to crypto reporter Colin Wu, calling it \"false reporting.\"\"Firstly, that group is blocked from using the RAILGUN system by the \\'Private Proofs of Innocence\\' system, which went live over a year ago,\" Railgun stated. \"Secondly, it was a mistaken, false allegation in the first place,\" the protocol asserted.Railgun, founded in January 2021, utilizes zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to shield wallet balances, transaction history, and transaction details, allowing users to interact with decentralized apps (DApps) on Ethereum or other supported chains while maintaining privacy. The protocol launched its Private Proofs of Innocence (Private POI) system in January 2023, which uses cryptographic assurance to prevent funds from known undesirable transactions or actors from entering the Railgun smart contract .Vitalik Buterin recently defended Railgun , arguing that \"privacy is normal\" and that the privacy pools protocol makes it \"much harder for bad actors to join the pool.\" Buterin\\'s endorsement coincided with reports that he had sent 100 ETH worth $325,000 to Railgun on April 15, causing a surge in the protocol\\'s native token, Railgun (RAIL). The token is currently trading at $1.17, up 86% over the past seven days.According to Dune Analytics data, Railgun\\'s total volume has reached $962 million , with its total value locked on Ethereum, where most of the protocol\\'s activity takes place, crossing $25 million.The allegations against Railgun come at a time when privacy protocols are facing increased scrutiny from regulators. Last week, U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Adewale Adeyemo highlighted the misuse of anonymity-enhancing technologies by terrorist groups and rogue nations to conceal the origins of illicit crypto funds. In response, several crypto trading platforms, including Binance and OKX, have delisted privacy-focused digital assets to comply.',\n",

Yet, this surge of FUD among traders may not be as bad as it sounds. Chart by TradingViewAs markets start to bounce back, going against the crowd's doomsday predictions, there is a lesson to be learned. When everyone is selling in a panic, it often sets the stage for a turnaround. This is where we are now – at a potential tipping point where the pessimism has gone so far that it might just flip the other way.According to sentiment analysis, negative tendencies on the market could indicate a coming rebound, as the markets have a history of moving contrary to the crowd's fears. The expectation is that this trend could hold up until the hype and excitement (FOMO) surrounding the halving event take center stage again, just as they did a few weeks ago.On the price chart, Bitcoin and Ethereum have crucial levels to watch. For Bitcoin, the resistance to beat is around $67,000. If it manages to rise above this, it might signal a larger recovery. Ethereum faces resistance near $3,500 and has support at $2,700. If it holds above support and breaks past resistance, it could be a sign of a more sustained upswing.While the current sentiment is in the dumps, history has shown that such sentiment extremes can precede market recoveries. The collective mood swings of investors, from fear to greed and back again, are part of the crypto industry.Just as panic can spread quickly, so too can a recovery start – often when it is least expected.

Currently, only BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) report positive daily inflows.ETF researcher James Seyffart notes that this stagnation is common, as most ETFs are not seeing new money.

       "  'description': 'Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has raised concerns about the sustainability of the surging valuations in the cryptocurrency sector.\\xa0In a , Marszalek expressed skepticism about the generous valuations being thrown around by project teams as the industry experiences a notable increase in billion-dollar funding rounds for early-stage crypto startups.The CEO’s observations serve as a reminder of the investment frenzy that accompanied the pandemic-era bull run in tokens, which yielded mixed results for investors.\\xa0While acknowledging the desire for financial returns, Marszalek emphasized the need for caution in the current market environment.Crypto.com’s VC Arm Scale Back Crypto.com Capital, the venture capital arm of Crypto.com, had $500 million allocated for investments in startups in the sector as of January 2022.\\xa0However, over the past 18 months, the fund has scaled back its investment activity.\\xa0Publicly available information shows that Crypto.com has made only four investments since the start of 2023, compared to 35 investments in the preceding two years.Despite the resurgence of exuberance in crypto venturing, Marszalek stated that the fund aimed to be reasonable and prudent in its investment approach.\\xa0While he did not disclose the exact figure, Marszalek mentioned that the unit has made approximately 70 investments to date, deploying a significant amount of capital.The industry as a whole has witnessed recent venture capital deals that highlight the soaring valuations.\\xa0Blockchain platform Berachain, operated by pseudonymous founders with bear-themed avatars, secured $100 million at a valuation of at least $1 billion.\\xa0Additionally, software firm Merkle Manufactory, the creator of decentralized social-media network Farcaster, and blockchain developer Monad Labs have also achieved billion-dollar valuations in recent weeks.Crypto.com Capital has participated in some of these funding rounds, including Berachain’s raise, as well as investments in staking firm Kiln and gaming startup Arcade2Earn.\\xa0The venture arm primarily focuses on seed-stage and Series A rounds.However, Marszalek acknowledged that limited partners (LPs) providing capital for venture funds share his wariness of the industry’s rekindled hype.LPs are reluctant to invest additional funds until venture funds demonstrate tangible returns.Marszalek Bullish on Bitcoin Marszalek has recently said that\\xa0Bitcoin\\xa0may experience some selling pressure in the lead-up to the highly anticipated halving event, but the long-term\\xa0outlook remains bullish.\\xa0While acknowledging the possibility of selling pressure in the near term due to the “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news” trading phenomenon, he emphasized that the halving will have a significant positive impact on the market in the long run.\\xa0“Over a longer period, the halving will make a substantial difference and is a positive development for the market.”Specifically, Marszalek expressed optimism about the six months following the halving, predicting “pretty decent action” in the Bitcoin market during that period.\\xa0Despite short-term uncertainties, he remains bullish on Bitcoin’s future and believes that the halving will ultimately drive the digital asset to new heights.As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $63,575, largely flat over the past day.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin’s soon-to-launch “Runes” token standard will allow the premiere crypto network to catch up to rivals in the realm of DeFi, predicted asset manager Franklin Templeton in a Monday report.The Promise Of Runes The firm released a expanding on the upcoming technology over Twitter, which is set to go live at the same time as the Bitcoin halving.“Runes introduces a new token standard on Bitcoin layer 1, which improves upon the current fungible token standards on Bitcoin (BRC-20s)” Franklin explained.Runes – Bitcoin’s new Fungible Token Standard — Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTI_DA) Tokens are blockchain-based assets that are different from that blockchain’s native currency, such as BTC on Bitcoin, or ETH on Ethereum. Until 2023, there was no way to mint tokens on Bitcoin’s main blockchain, locking it away from many applications available on other chains, including NFTs, stablecoins, and DeFi.That changed in early 2023 with the rise of Ordinals, as invented by Casey Rordamor. The protocol lets users inscribe individual satoshis with unique identification numbers, and embed them with arbitrary data, enabling NFTs.Bitcoin NFTs stood out from Ethereum and Solana NFTs, in that their image data was embedded directly into Bitcoin’s blockchain, rather than on a centralized server.How Large Could Runes Become? As of today, Bitcoin hosts a larger NFT market than both blockchains, according to . In the past 30 days, its processed $462 million in NFT trading volume, versus Ethereum’s $296 million.A developer named Domo later built on the Ordinals protocol to enable BRC-20 tokens, though the creator himself admitted that such tokens were highly inefficient.Today, Runes – once again created by Rordamor – are designed to be much more efficient, requiring less blockchain-based data to move around than BRC-20 tokens, or even Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens. Some other benefits of Runes include compatibility with the lightning network, and increased transaction privacy.“Bitcoin is positioned well to close the gap between its fungible market cap versus that of other blockchain,” wrote Franklin.Bitcoin’s total market cap right now is $1.2 trillion, while its fungible token cap is just $600 million. By contrast, Ethereum’s market cap is $378 billion, while its fungible token market cap is $499 billion.“We are excited to see if Runes can do for Bitcoin’s Fungible token and DeFi market what Ordinals did for Bitcoin’s Non-fungible token market,” the report concluded.',\n",

This equates to roughly 221,000 BTC being taken off the market, a market shock mathematically much larger than even a Bitcoin halving event.In fact, the next Bitcoin halving is due later this week. It will cut Bitcoin’s supply inflation rate in half for the fourth time in the network’s history. Starting around April 20, the asset’s daily supply issuance will shrink from 900 BTC to 450 BTC, causing an even greater market supply shortage.There is a supply squeeze mere days away. Blackrock and other ETF’s are buying in excess 10,000 a day. What do you think will happen when only 450 new are mined a day ?Micheal Saykor gives us an idea — Tommy ₿oy⚡️21m (@CooliganFields) However, Bybit’s figures around ETF inflows may be outdated: the funds have seen very few net inflows since the beginning of April, and the price of Bitcoin has declined from $69,000 down to $62,000 over that time period.Some cite escalating as a potential catalyst for the selloff, while others believe investors could be selling their BTC in time for U.S. tax season.Bitcoin Miner Behavior Bybit also said there may be a pronounced Bitcoin selloff in the short term after the halving – particularly from weak mining firms.“Unprofitable miners might start selling their Bitcoin reserves in order to support their operations,” wrote Bybit. “However, once their reserves run out, the overall sell-side supply to CEXs will shrink.”Bybit also noted that miners had acted slightly differently from their pre-halving behaviour in 2022, however. While miners four years ago steadily accumulated leading up to the halving, firms have shown signs of unloading their reserves earlier in the current cycle.“Bitcoin tends to rally twelve months after each halving, and there’s a high probability that we might see a new ATH this time,” the report stated,',\n",

       "  'description': \"With cryptocurrency markets a sea of red on Tuesday, the market continues to be on shakey ground due to concerns about Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions and the diminishing likelihood of near-term Fed interest rate cuts. Investors are thus turning to smaller and lesser-known altcoins as they hunt for the best crypto to buy today.Bitcoin (BTC) was around $63,000, probing its multi-month range lows today. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was holding just to the north of $3,000.Both are down sharply from March highs, though losses are modest compared to the retracements seen by many altcoins.While Bitcoin is down 11% in 30 days, Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are each down 20%.

TIA is up an even more impressive 44% from last week’s lows near $7.50.If the crypto can break back to the north of $11.50 resistance, its narrative could turn bullish.Celestia could be the best crypto to buy now if it can pump back to yearly highs. Source: TradingViewIf TIA can recover to its yearly highs of around $21, that could mean a nearly 2x upside from current levels.TIA could be the best crypto to buy now for those looking to benefit from the market’s recent dip.Pepe (Pepe)Another coin attempting to make a comeback on Tuesday is Pepe (PEPE). The legendary in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.Pepe’s technical outlook recently took a turn for the worse, however when the meme coin broke to the south of a pennant structure.Pepe could be the best crypto to buy now if it can 2x back to yearly highs.

Hence, it could easily be the best crypto to buy now.Fantom (FTM)Fantom (FTM) bulls are trying to regain control on Tuesday as the broader market struggles.According to CoinMarketCap, in 24 hours and has recovered to around $0.67.The token is eyeing a rebound to $1.0, but it must first overcome resistance around $0.77.A break above could open the door to a continued recovery to 2024 highs in the $1.20s.With FTM’s potential to net investors near-term gains of 2x, it ranks amongst the best cryptos to buy now.Alternative Crypto Investment Strategy to Consider – Presales Investing in smaller, lesser-known altcoins is a great way to make a quick crypto profit.However, investors looking to increase their risk profile shouldn’t neglect another highly profitable strategy: investing in new crypto\\xa0ICOs.Up-and-coming\\xa0web3\\xa0start-ups often look to raise funds in their infancy by selling their native protocol token.These sales are almost always conducted at a steep discount to the project’s potential. For example, most presales will sell their token at a price that gives them a market cap of $10-30 million.If a good project gains traction, it can easily reach a market cap in the hundreds of millions. So, presale investors can often make as much as 10x or more gains.Of course, investing in new crypto ICOs comes with many of the same risks as traditional start-up investing. The success of a project relies heavily upon the competency of management and execution.With so many new crypto ICOs to choose from, getting started can be a daunting task.Luckily, the experienced team at Cryptonews has already done a lot of digging.

       "  'title': 'Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Crashes Before Halving – Is The Bull Market Over?',\n",
       "  'description': 'Bitcoin Price PredictionAs the cryptocurrency community anticipates the next Bitcoin halving event, expected around April 19 or 20, speculations about its impact on Bitcoin’s price are intensifying.This scheduled reduction in mining rewards, which decreases the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, has historically been a catalyst for significant price movements.Presently, is trading near $63000, showing a modest increase of 0.05% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of approximately $44 billion.With Bitcoin’s market capitalization holding strong at around $1.239 trillion, and nearly 19.7 million BTC in circulation, the market is closely watching how this halving could influence future Bitcoin price prediction.Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin (BTC/USD) shows the pivot point at $61,415, which is critical for determining BTC’s short-term direction. Observing the immediate resistance levels, Bitcoin faces its first major challenge at $64,873.Beyond this, additional hurdles stand at $67,846 and $71,608. Conversely, the support levels begin at $58,181, extending to $55,649, and further down to $52,859.From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 41, indicating that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold at this juncture, suggesting a potential stability in price movements.The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) rests at $64,718, which is just above the current market price, signaling that there might be a slight bearish sentiment in the near term.Notably, a ‘triple bottom’ pattern around the $61,400 level is providing substantial support for Bitcoin.Bitcoin Price PredictionThis pattern, coupled with the formation of a hammer candlestick pattern just above this zone, suggests that there could be a buying resurgence if Bitcoin maintains above this threshold. Such technical formations are often interpreted by traders as bullish signals, potentially leading to an uptick in buying activity.However, should Bitcoin break below the pivot point of $61,415, it could trigger a sharper decline, directing the digital asset towards the lower support levels identified. This scenario would likely be driven by a shift in trader sentiment, leading to increased selling pressure.In conclusion, the current technical analysis for Bitcoin remains cautiously bullish above the $61,415 level.Conversely, a downturn below the pivotal $61,415 could intensify selling trends, possibly causing the price to test further supports at lower thresholds.

       "  'description': 'Publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 Corp announced on April 16 the initialization of self-mining operations at its new Salt Creek facility, only 78 days after breaking ground in the area.The Texas-based facility boasts a favourable energy profile, which is expected to reduce mining costs by 30% compared to the firm’s hosting facilities.Hut 8 Expands Its Mining Fleet The new site energization represents just one-third of the entire facility, charged with 63 megawatts (MW) of power in total.“With Salt Creek, we gain critical control over our miner fleet and operating costs as we head into the halving,” said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot in a .“Our outlook on energy prices at the site suggests that the potential for cost savings relative to our cost of mining at Kearney and Granbury is in line with the 30% reduction initially projected,” he continued.Less than three months after breaking ground, we’ve officially energized one third of our 63 MW Salt Creek site in Culberson County, Texas.💪Our team made rapid energization possible by removing more than 25,000 miners on 20 loaded transports from our hosted facilities in just… — Hut 8 (@Hut8Corp) The Bitcoin halving is a one-in-four-year event that cuts the rate at which the Bitcoin network rewards miners with new coins in half. The next halving is expected to take place within the next four days and will reduce the number of new BTC per day from 900 BTC to 450 BTC.Though the halving is widely viewed as bullish for Bitcoin in the long run, the event creates immediate pain for its mining industry by nearly cutting its total revenue in half.As such, only the most efficient miners are equipped to stay profitable, by producing the highest possible “hash rate” while expending the least amount of energy.Hut’s Move Towards Efficiency Announced earlier this month, Hut 8 strategically relocated its most efficient mining machines from its Kearney and Granbury facilities to enable rapid energization of its Salt Creek fleet, and to maximize its hash rate ahead of the halving. Last month, Hut also closed one of its mining facilities in Alberta, Canada due to power disruptions and high energy costs.Hut 8 has also deployed Reactor, an automated energy curtailment software that ensures miners stay online when they can mine profitably.“We remain on track to deliver an incredibly cost-effective buildout,” said Genroot. “Our expected all-in cost of $275,000 per megawatt or less represents a 40% savings versus recent acquisitions in the area.”Following the announcement, HUT stock went up 0.9% since Monday, despite BTC, miners, and other Bitcoin-related stocks experiencing slight drawdowns on Tuesday.',\n",

       "  'description': ', is down today, falling 3.45% to reach $2,990 on April 16.The price of Ethereum\\'s native token, Ether This decline is part of a correction that started on March 11, when ETH\\'s price reached a three-year high of $4,095. Since then, the cryptocurrency has retreated by 27%, mirroring declines in the broader crypto market.At first glance, the sell-off appears to be a typical correction within a bull market, suggesting that some traders are taking profits at Ether’s recent highs.  has been further exacerbated by the escalating geopolitical crisis in the Middle East and the increasing likelihood of prolonged high interest rates in the U.S.However, the decline in Risk aversion mood hurts ETH priceToday, Ether\\'s price drop follows Israel\\'s announcement of impending retaliation against Iran, signaling an escalation in Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions.\\xa0 dropping towards $60,000 and numerous altcoins experiencing\\xa0up to 30% declines.The market\\'s bearish reaction is akin to what transpired over the weekend when Iran launched drone and missile attacks against Israel. This offensive triggered a market-wide pullback, with Bitcoin The downturns across the cryptocurrency market reflect increased risk aversion among investors. This mood is strengthening further due to a resilient U.S. economy, which has dampened the potential of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.For instance, as of April 16, CME futures data showed an 81.5% probability of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in June, compared to around 50% two weeks prior. A higher-for-longer interest rate is perceived as bearish by crypto traders.Simultaneously, the cost of options betting on further gains in the U.S. dollar has escalated to its highest level since November, indicating a shift towards safer assets.This has further dampened buying interest in the Ethereum and broader crypto market today.Ethereum whales are panickingEther\\'s decline today appears further due to decreasing ETH holdings among its richest investors, also known as \"whales.\"For example, since March, there has been a significant decrease in the number of entities holding at least 1 million, 100,000, and 10,000 ETH tokens. The number of addresses holding 1,000 ETH has slightly increased, suggesting that this group is compensating for the declines observed in the larger holdings.Large holders, or whales, often have significant influence on market sentiment. When they reduce their holdings, it might be interpreted by the market as a lack of confidence in Ethereum\\'s future prospects, potentially leading to a bearish sentiment and a drop in price.Ethereum long liquidationsEther\\'s price drop further coincides with the liquidation of $73.41 million worth of perpetual swap contracts, out of which $58.68 million are longs.When a long position is liquidated, the asset held is automatically sold in the market. If a significant number of liquidations occur simultaneously, this can cause a substantial increase in the supply of the asset being dumped onto the market, pushing prices down even further.Related:\\xa0Stocks and crypto at the edge of ‘significant’ correction: 10x ResearchFurthermore, the ETH price drop occurred after a sharp decline in its open interest (OI)—from $14.62 billion on April 9 to $11.07 billion on April 16. Meanwhile, the funding rate rose slightly to 0.007% per eight hours, still lower than its recent peak of 0.094% per eight hours.The slight increase in funding rates, while indicating some bullish sentiment, may not be sufficient to counterbalance the negative impact of the sharp decrease in OI. It shows some willingness among Ether traders to hold longs, but it might not be robust enough to drive a price increase if the overall market participation is declining.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

       "  'description': ' price plummeted by 21% between April 9 and April 14, hitting a 50-day low. Although it has recouped some of its losses, Ether continues to show signs of weakness following a failed attempt to breach the $3,200 resistance on April 14. Traders now question if the $3,000 support will hold for longer.Ether Analysts are not optimistic about the spot Ether ETF approval oddsInvestors are cautiously optimistic about the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in May. However, the mixed signals from on-chain and derivatives data suggest the possibility of further corrections before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes its decision.Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck investment firm, expressed doubt that the spot Ether ETFs would receive approval in May. He pointed to the SEC\\'s extended inactivity on a list of seven pending applications, including those from major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, and VanEck.Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, noted that the absence of \"critical feedback\" from the regulator, even in face-to-face meetings, signals low approval odds, possibly around 35%. James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, added, \"There’s no reason for the SEC to have done absolutely nothing for months when we knew this was coming.\", the leading cryptocurrency, also fell 14% in the five days leading up to April 13. A more nuanced analysis would compare Ether’s performance against its direct competitors, particularly those involved with decentralized applications (DApps).It would be simplistic to attribute Ether’s recent downturn solely to the dim prospects of spot Ether ETF approval, especially since Bitcoin  experienced a significantly steeper fall. However, these figures do not necessarily reflect the activity levels within each network\\'s DApps. Thus, it’s crucial to examine the trends in total value locked (TVL) across these networks.. Conversely, Solana  and the 10% decrease in Tron Since April 9, Ether\\'s 15% decline was more pronounced than the 8% drop in BNB According to DefiLlama, Ethereum\\'s network TVL surged to its highest level in over 13 months on April 15, reaching 16.4 million ETH, marking a 14.8% increase on a month-to-month basis. In comparison, the BNB Chain\\'s TVL remained stable at 9.5 million BNB, while Tron’s deposits saw a 1% decline over the 30 days leading up to April 15.DApps activity and ETH derivatives offer a mixed prospect for priceThe initial analysis suggests that the Ethereum network holds an advantage over its competitors, yet a more detailed examination is necessary, as not all decentralized applications (DApps) require substantial deposit bases. It\\'s essential to assess network activity by examining transaction volumes and active user counts.According to DappRadar, the Ethereum blockchain maintained its dominant position with a 7-day DApp volume of $45.7 billion, significantly outperforming its main rival, the BNB Chain. Moreover, despite a modest 3% drop in active addresses (UAW) since April 9, used as a proxy for user engagement with DApps, Ethereum\\'s decline was less severe compared to the BNB Chain, which saw a 7% fall.Analyzing ETH options is vital to gauge whether professional traders have become more pessimistic about Ether\\'s prospects. Generally, a delta skew metric above 7% points to expectations of a price drop, while a skew below -7% indicates a bullish outlook.On April 16, Ether’s options skew metric reached its highest level in over two months, breaching into bearish territory after hovering around the 7% mark for four days. This trend suggests that whales and market makers are demanding a premium for downside price protection on ETH.On one hand, the anticipation of a decision on the spot Ether ETF in May bolsters Ether\\'s price, and the network\\'s on-chain activity, though stagnant, has performed better than that of its competitors. However, the growing risk aversion among professional traders on April 16, as indicated by derivatives markets, advises against overlooking the potential for further price corrections of ETH below $2,900.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

       "  'description': \"Unprecedented demand, together with the price-pumping allure of Doge Day (which falls the same day as Bitcoin’s highly-anticipated halving on Saturday), has brought Dogecoin20’s DOGE20 presale to an early conclusion after raising over $10 million, according to a new announcement on X.\\xa0 Community Announcement! 📢Exciting news! 🎉 We've adjusted the official $DOGE20 Claim to an earlier date, driven by the overwhelming demand from our community!🌟Set your reminders for the new date: April 18th, 2024 at 10 am UTC! ⏳Don't miss it! 🚀 — Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) The ICO for Dogecoin (DOGE) rival Dogecoin20 (DOGE20) ran throughout March and was originally scheduled to end on Saturday April 20, but the team has concluded it early and moved the claim date to 10AM UTC, Thursday April 18.\\xa0That means DOGE20 will be landing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) two days ahead of schedule, although the team is keeping details as to which DEXs close to its chest. It also means anyone wishing to acquire DOGE20 tokens now has to wait until Thursday’s public launch.\\xa0In any case, the project now has a two-day headstart to exploit the upside potential of Bitcoin’s halving and Doge Day in a canny tactical play that could ignite a tinderbox launch for Ethereum’s hottest new good boy.\\xa0Dogecoin20 is a huge hit among eagle-eyed meme coin investors for its simple premise: it’s Dogecoin but cleaner, greener, and packing more utility and value thanks to its Ethereum compatibility and staking incentives.\\xa0Now, with Saturday, April 20 just around the corner, Dogecoin20’s new launch date on Thursday could catalyze some sweltering gains.\\xa0This being crypto, nothing is set in stone, but it so happens that both Bitcoin’s halving and Doge Day fall on 4/20, a day that already has cultural significance for meme fans because of its global stoner associations.\\xa0Meme coins will get a novelty look-in that day, particularly canine-related ones. It is also the day of Bitcoin’s halving, and history has already shown us the heady upside potential of Bitcoin halvings. The past three halvings have all led to rallies.\\xa0The Bitcoin Halving and Doge Day: A Quick Primer. As a canine-themed meme coin packing lots of utility, Dogecoin20 is uniquely poised to benefit from both the halving and Doge Day.\\xa0Bitcoin’s upcoming halving is crypto’s current price-driving narrative. The first thing to bear in mind about halvings is they don’t come often. They come approximately once every four years.\\xa0Saturday will be Bitcoin’s fourth since launching in 2009.\\xa0Each halving cuts Bitcoin miners’ BTC rewards in half. At present, miners get 6.25BTC for every block of transactions they validate and add to the blockchain. After Saturday, they’ll only earn 3.125 BTC per block.\\xa0What does this have to do with Dogecoin20? Well, the halving affects everybody.\\xa0Since miners control the issuance of new Bitcoin, the halving will bottleneck the supply. Basic supply and demand dictates that if demand for an asset remains consistent through a supply squeeze, the asset becomes more valuable. This is why halvings have always led to bull runs.\\xa0Bitcoin rallied this year as a result of fresh institutional and retail demand for BTC following the launch of 11 US-approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) back in January.\\xa0The ETFs have given anyone with a brokerage account a way to buy and hold Bitcoin and exploit its price movements through a regulated investment vehicle. The pitch has succeeded in winning over some of Wall Street’s more traditional investors. It has also added value to the entire market.\\xa0On New Year’s Day, 2024, crypto had a combined market cap of about $1.65 trillion. This figure has since mushroomed to $2.41 trillion largely off the back of ETF hype and steady institutional inflows.\\xa0And not only is Dogecoin20 riding the news with the rest of the market, thanks to the novelty factor of Doge Day and 4/20 arriving with the halving, there’s no limit to the potential pump.\\xa0Dogecoin20 is Ethereum’s ERC-20 Doge Altcoin So, how does DOGE20 work? To begin with, the “20” is a reference to the ERC-20 token standard. ERC-20 is the set of smart contracts on Ethereum underpinning every fungible token of note on the network, from canine rivals like SHIB, PEPE and FLOKI to utility tokens for DEXs like Uniswap, or Layer 2 solutions like Polygon (MATIC) and Chainlink (LINK).\\xa0This makes Dogecoin20 substantially cheaper, faster and greener to use than Dogecoin. That’s because Ethereum uses an energy efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, whereby the miners with the biggest stake validate the most transactions and get the most mining rewards.By comparison, the original Dogecoin utilizes the older tech that powers Bitcoin: Proof-of-Work (PoW), in which the miners with the most power/hardware validate the most transactions.\\xa0Back in August 2023, Ethereum was processing . By comparison, Bitcoin processed 550,000 transactions for that entire month.Given Dogecoin20’s technological advantages over more established rivals, alongside the novelty factor and halving/Doge Day hype, Dogecoin20’s decision to launch two days ahead of schedule is a deft sleight of hand that could attract some blistering near-term returns.\\xa0Got FOMO? You’ll have to wait until Thursday at 10AM UTC to buy Dogecoin20 on DEXs.\\xa0In the meantime, visit the website.\",\n",

While historical trends and potential outcomes might be crucial to consider, past performance might not indicate future results.In separate news, the Ethereum community is debating a change to the ETH monetary policy in response to proposals aimed at limiting the staking pool's rapid expansion.

The asset's performance over the past week is even more alarming, with a notable drop of 15.60%. This steep decline comes amid a broader market\\xa0sell-off driven by recent geopolitical tensions, which have cast a shadow over the entire crypto market.Importance of support zoneThe identified support zone is crucial for several reasons. First, the significant volume of Ethereum held in this price range across a multitude of addresses suggests that many investors have vested interests in these levels. A sustained breach of these support levels could trigger automated sell orders and further exacerbate the selling pressure on Ethereum.Second, the recent market volatility has been influenced by a confluence of factors, including regulatory uncertainties and broader macroeconomic conditions. These factors have created a challenging operating environment for ETH and other cryptocurrencies, leading to increased market uncertainty and investor caution.Furthermore, recent geopolitical tensions have added a layer of complexity to the market dynamics, with investors seeking safe-haven assets and reevaluating their risk tolerance levels.

This raises questions about the whale's trading strategy and their ability to accurately time the market.According to Santiment, as crypto prices have been on the decline, Ethereum is seeing the fastest rise in its discussion rate. The new ETF approval in Hong Kong has sparked more interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency, even though shorts are rising rapidly.\",\n",

Data shows that its price plunged by around 90% as compared to its peak recorded in 2021.Bored Apes on a declineAs per the data provided, Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT’s minimum price dropped to stand slightly above 10 Ethereum. However, this is seen as a major decrease from the average of 120 Ether recorded in May 2022. If we calculate it in terms of dollar value then the NFT price has dropped from over $400,000 per NFT to just above $30,000.Data provided by NFT Price Floor shows that BAYC’s price floor stands at 11.05 ETH (approx value of $33,931), at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is calculated to be 1,161.4 ETH (approx value $3.6 million). However, its market cap stands at around 110,240 Ethereum (approx value of $337.2 million).Data from CryptoSlam indicates that trading volumes for BAYC have remained stable at around $1 million daily since 2022. It is important to note that Bored Apes is a collection of 10,000 digital monkeys on the Ethereum blockchain. Meanwhile, nearly 20% of the collection is still held by ten individual wallets, suggesting a concentrated ownership.A decline in NFTs’ or particularly BAYC signals a broader decrease in retail interest in Ethereum based NFT collections.

Over the past few days, Ethereum’s price has taken a nosedive, plunging to lows of $2,800 on April 12, echoing the broader downturn witnessed across the crypto landscape.However, in the face of volatility, a fascinating development has emerged: Ethereum whales, the behemoths of the crypto world, have begun to flex their muscles, showcasing strategic maneuvers that have captured the attention and speculation of the crypto community.Strategic Accumulation Amidst TurbulenceAs Ethereum’s price plummeted, Ethereum whales wasted no time in capitalizing on the opportunity. One notable example is the whale identified as “0x435,” which embarked on a strategic accumulation spree as the ETH price dipped.With a staggering investment of 70 million USDC, this whale acquired a hefty 23,790 ETH when Ethereum hit nearly $2,930.

It’s entirely arguable that, based on DOGE’s indicators, it should recover and rebound in the near future.Its 30-day moving average (orange) has declined well below its 200-day (blue), implying that it has bottomed out and should come back up again soon.Source: TradingViewSomething similar applies to DOGE’s relative strength index (purple), which has gradually recovered from sinking to 20 over the weekend, and which is now hovering around 50.As such, it suggests that the market has oversold DOGE in recent days and that the meme coin should return to growth, at least if buyers want a discount.DOGE’s volume does suggest that there’s enough interest in the coin to help it rise again pretty soon, with its level rising from about $2 billion last week to roughly $3.6 billion today.Much of this volume comes from selling, although the past few hours , as if whales are taking the opportunity to buy the dip.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) It’s also possible that some of the volume stems from , which saw the X owner allude to his role in boosting Dogecoin’s profile and keeping it in the spotlight.This tweet did temporarily pump DOGE’s price a little, before the market-wide decline brought the meme coin down with it.What it also does is underscore the possibility of additional support from Musk, whose X is planning to introduce digital payments this year.If such payments end up including crypto and DOGE options, then the Dogecoin price could certainly balloon.It would potentially break its ATH of $0.7316, although, without X payments, it may reach $0.30 by H2 2024.High-Potential Alternatives to Dogecoin In the event that some traders are unsure as to whether we’ll see DOGE payments on X anytime soon, they may prefer investing in low-cap alternatives that may rally as they grow and list on exchanges.And there happens to be a new and very good alternative to Dogecoin on the market right now: Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme coin that has raised more than $5 million in its increasingly popular presale.Another great milestone to start the day! 🌞 surpasses the $5 million mark! 💰 thanks you all and could not be happier with our growing community! 🐶🙌Next stop – $5.5M 🚀 — DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) Dogeverse will operate not only on Ethereum, but also on\\xa0Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base.And because it will be a multi-chain coin, DOGEVERSE will have wider application and utility than many other meme coins.Traders may end up using it on numerous trading platforms and apps, increasing its demand and ultimately supporting its price.Also supporting its price will be its deflationary tokenomics, with the token’s supply capped at 200 million.When combined with staking, such a cap could help bring about a supply squeeze, which in turn will again increase DOGEVERSE’s price over time.Set to list in the next few weeks, investors can participate in the token’s sale by visiting\\xa0the official Dogeverse website.1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000296, with this price rising every two days until the sale ends.Based on its fundamentals and tokenomics, this price could rise massively once Dogeverse launches and its token lists on exchanges.Buy DOGEVERSE Today',\n",

The round brought Puffer\\'s fully diluted token valuation to $200 million, Forouzani added.Puffer\\'s Series A round comes shortly after it raised funds from Binance Labs earlier this year. Last year, the project also raised a $5.5 million seed funding round and a $650,000 pre-seed round initially.Ethereum restaking gaining further momentumThe Ethereum restaking vertical has been gaining momentum since the launch of EigenLayer last year. This led to the launch of several EigenLayer-based platforms this year.

Arbitrum and Solana have each experienced 6 incidents, while Bitcoin has seen only two.Notably, the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector has been the most susceptible to these attacks, accounting for all reported incidents thus far this year.The top 10 largest losses so far this year are:Orbit Bridge: $81,680,000 Munchables: $62,800,000 PlayDapp: $32,350,000 FixedFloat: $26,100,000 GMEE: $15,000,000 WOOFi: $8,750,000 Coinspaid: $7,500,000 Abracadabra Money: $6,500,000 Seneca: $6,500,000 Gamma Strategies: $6,200,000The report additionally revealed that crypto users have incurred significant losses exceeding $437m through scams and hacks in 2024. Fraudulent activities, including rug pulls, also contributed to the total losses, albeit to a lesser extent, amounting to $14m.March Sees Lower Theft Rates Additionally, a recent CertiK report indicates a significant decline in crypto theft during March. The report detailed that malicious actors stole about $79m from DeFi projects, reflecting a substantial 48% decrease compared to the $160m stolen in February.In March, one of the most significant crypto thefts involved a MakerDAO-based smart contract deployed by Curio on Ethereum. While initial estimates placed the loss around $16m, PeckShield later revised the figure, suggesting the actual amount stolen could be closer to $40m.Prisma Finance suffered the second-largest loss in March, with a flash loan attack leading to the misappropriation of about $12.4m. The attacker, who self-identified as a white-hat hacker, initially promised to return the stolen funds following an online conference held by the project’s team.However, during the event, the attacker’s demands shifted, requiring the team members to publicly disclose their identities and issue an apology.According to CertiK, security breaches were found to extend beyond DeFi protocols. The Binance-backed platform NFPrompt experienced a cyber intrusion, resulting in misappropriated funds of about $10m. Additionally, the WooFi decentralized exchange reported losses of roughly $8.5m following a hacking incident.Online Safety Practices for Crypto Users According to Smart Betting Guide, securing crypto involves keeping passwords and seed phrases off cloud storage. Seed phrases, acting as recovery keys, are vulnerable to theft by hackers attempting to steal cryptocurrency.For further protection, the report recommended using a hardware wallet. This device, resembling a USB drive, securely stores a user’s private keys offline (cold storage). When needed, the keys can be connected online to complete transactions.Further, users should implement critical security measures. These include refraining from clicking links in dubious emails, implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for logins, and avoiding interaction with online pop-ups or links. Additionally, vigilance against messages promising rapid financial gains is advised, as these often originate from fraudulent accounts, a prevalent social media scam.',\n",

The vast majority of Fijians rely on cash for most of their daily transactions.The Reserve Bank of Fiji Governor Ariff Ali has acknowledged that there are businesses promoting cryptocurrency investment schemes in Fiji through various platforms including social media.Ali stressed that the central bank has not licensed or authorised anybody to offer cryptocurrency investments or trade in virtual assets in Fiji. “Therefore, the public is strongly advised to refrain from participating in cryptocurrency investment or trading schemes currently being promoted in Fiji,” said the bank.Crypto Regulations Making Significant Strides Last year it emerged more than 40 countries had made significant strides in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023, indicating a growing global trend towards wider cryptocurrency adoption.According to a report from in 2023, several countries have undertaken various initiatives to develop regulations and legislation specifically tailored to the cryptocurrency industry.\\xa0The PwC report said the regulatory efforts are primarily focused on four key focus areas, including stablecoin regulation, travel rule compliance, licensing and listing guidance, and overall crypto framework development.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Hong Kong asset managers, including units of China Asset Management (ChinaAMC) and Harvest Global, may soon launch their spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds as early as later this month, OSL confirmed with The Block today.“Reports suggest a spot BTC ETF may start in late April, with a spot ETH ETF following shortly after,” said Patrick Pan, chairman of the board and CEO of OSL. “All parties are working expeditiously to complete the process. However, exact dates remain unconfirmed at this time.”“We view the recent approval in principle positively as it moves the industry closer to launching spot crypto ETFs,” Pan added.Pan today told Foresight News, a Chinese-language crypto news outlet, that the spot bitcoin ETFs may become available for investors as early as late April.Pan’s comments come after the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on Monday gave in-principle approval to several asset managers, including those managed by ChinaAMC, Harvest, Bosera and HashKey, to offer spot bitcoin ETFs and spot ether ETFs. OSL will act as a sub-custodian and infrastructure service provider for the ETFs issued by ChinaAMC and Harvest.ChinaAMC expects strong demandKatie He, head of product and strategy of ChinaAMC (HK), told The Block today that the demand for their upcoming spot crypto ETFs may be “substantial” as only professional investors in Hong Kong could have access to U.S.-listed spot ETFs.\\xa0He said that Hong Kong-based investors will have three options to gain exposure to cryptocurrency when spot crypto ETFs go live.\\xa0“They can access spot bitcoin on the SFC-licensed VATPs, or they can get access through futures-based bitcoin or ether ETFs which may raise efficiency concerns due to high rolling costs associated with futures contracts,” He continued. “Meanwhile, only professional investors in Hong Kong could have access to US-listed spot ETFs, so the introduction of spot products in Hong Kong really provides the investment opportunity to a wider audience.”Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, however, threw a bit of cold water on the excitement. \"Don\\'t expect a lot of flows ... we think they\\'ll be lucky to get $500 million,\" he wrote on X on Monday, adding that the Hong Kong ETF market is “tiny” and “Chinese locals cannot buy these, at least officially.”Some in the crypto industry have said that the upcoming Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs may attract substantial investor interest from the Chinese mainland through the Southbound Stock Connect program. However, this argument may be weak as the Stock Connect program currently does not allow mainland investors to invest in crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong — let alone spot crypto counterparts.Gary Tiu, executive director and head of regulatory affairs of OSL, told The Block on Monday that crypto ETFs have not been included in the eligible securities list of the Stock Connect program yet, “but I think the possibility or at least the potential for such inclusion is something that the market certainly likes.”In-kind featureWhat sets the upcoming Hong Kong spot crypto products apart from their U.S. counterparts is their in-kind feature, according to He. “The in-kind dealing provides convenience to switch spot Bitcoin to a fully regulated spot Bitcoin ETF managed by a professional fund manager and regulated custodians, providing ease of trading as well as reducing the various risks such as hacking and fraud encountered by investors when investing directly in Bitcoin.”He explained that the demand for a Hong Kong spot bitcoin and ether ETF would “depend on factors such as the level of interest in cryptocurrencies within the Hong Kong market, investor decision for diversified investment options, and macro environment.”Tiu of OSL said that the in-kind feature is significant as it hasn’t been done in other markets, “certainly not in the retail fund space.”“What it means is if you have an investor who has long BTC. But they don\\'t want to exit the BTC position. But they want to swap it for another type of instrument — for example, for an ETF instrument or for an interest in the fund that tracks the performance of BTC — this now gives them the channel to do so,” Tiu added.Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

       "  'description': 'Cryptocurrency exchange OKX has joined the likes of Coinbase in launching an in-house Ethereum-based layer-2 network to provide lower fees and interoperability for users interacting with decentralized applications.OKX’s launched the public mainnet of X Layer, its zero-knowledge proof powered network, on April 15. The network was built using Polygon’s chain development kit (CDK) and enables shared state and liquidity across multiple blockchain networks using the Ethereum scaling protocol’s Aggregation Layer.An announcement shared with Cointelegraph notes that X Layer provides faster, cheaper transaction capabilities when interacting with on-chain applications. The network uses ZK-proofs, the underlying technology used by various Ethereum layer-2 networks for improved security and scalability. X Layer is EVM-compatible, allowing developers to launch or migrate Ethereum-based decentralized apps (DApps) without having to rewrite the underlying code. A statement from OKX chief marketing officer Haider Rafique notes that X Layer and other layer-2 networks are set to become integral infrastructure for an interconnected Web3 ecosystem. “We are building an ecosystem that is as seamless and interoperable as possible. We think X Layer has limitless potential thanks to our strong community and its connectivity with other Ethereum-based networks,” Rafique said.OKX launched the mainnet beta of X Layer in November 2023, which attracted more than 50 Web3 DApps to launch on the testnet. OKX notes that DApps including the Graph, Curve, LayerZero, QuickSwap, Galaxy and Timeswap are in the process of deploying on its proprietary layer-2 network. X Layer will allow OKX users to transfer assets, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies on OKX and access nearly 200 DApps offering token swaps, staking and smart contract functionality. OKX’s native OKB token acts as X Layer’s native token and is used to pay gas fees on the network. Polygon CDK is touted to provide symbiotic benefits for OKX, X Layer and other chains connected to Polygon’s AggLayer. X Layer essentially connects to other chains built on Polygon CDK through the AggLayer, which allows for the transition of liquidity between these chains. According to Polygon CEO Marc Boiron, this creates an interconnected network of liquidity across different blockchain protocols“X Layer’s connection to the AggLayer solves the fragmentation of liquidity and users across chains on the AggLayer so they can all grow together. OKX’s 50 million users now have an easy path to onboarding to X Layer and all the other chains connected to the AggLayer.”Investment management firm VanEck estimates that Ethereum layer-2 networks could exceed $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030. These networks have become integral to helping Ethereum achieve scale, powering low-fee, secure and decentralized transactions and applications.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'description': \" exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong may not be as big of a deal as some may think, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. and Ether Three recently approved spot Bitcoin On April 15, The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued conditional approvals to three offshore Chinese asset managers to begin issuing spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. The asset managers cleared for approval include Harvest Fund Management, Bosera Asset Management, and China Asset Management.\\xa0However, in an April 15 post to X, Balchunas shot down lofty predictions that the ETFs could generate $25 billion in inflows and pointed to four main reasons why crypto investors should temper their expectations for the recently approved products. “Don't expect a lot of flows — I saw one estimate of $25b that's insane. We think they'll be lucky to get $500m.”Justifying his predictions, Balchunas explained that the Hong Kong ETF market is “tiny” when compared to countries like the United States, adding that these ETFs don’t allow Chinese retail investors with official access to the products. Balchunas noted these three prospective ETF issuers were tiny relative to “big fish” asset management giants such as BlackRock — which currently boasts more than $9 trillion in assets under management. “U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have more assets than the entire HK ETF market,” wrote Balchunas in a follow-up post to X. Additionally, Balchunas said the capital environment for these funds was far less efficient than elsewhere, and fees would likely be set around the 1-2% mark — a far cry from the “dirt cheap fees in the U.S. Terrordome.”“The underlying ecosystem there is less [liquidity] efficient = these ETFs will likely see wide spreads and prem discounts,” said Balchunas. “Takeaway: Other countries adding [Bitcoin] ETFs is no doubt additive but it's nickel-dime compared to the mighty US market.”On the other hand, the chief crypto analyst at Real Vision and former crypto analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, Jamie Coutts,\\xa0said that despite recent reservations at the size of the Hong Kong ETF market, the products would open up a “massive pool of capital” for Chinese investors, who Coutts says are already savvy with skirting government-imposed capital controls.Notably, the Hong Kong FSC approved the spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs to be launched using an in-kind model, meaning new ETF shares can be issued directly using BTC and ETH.The in-kind creation model stands in contrast to the cash-create redemption model, which allows issuers to create new ETF shares only with cash. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs currently use the cash-create model, with the SEC fearing that cash-create could lead to money laundering and fraud-related issues. The spot ETFs are slated for launch in roughly two weeks' time. \",\n",

       "  'description': 'Bitcoin Price PredictionBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, recently showcased its resilience by rebounding above $66,270, a significant recovery from a recent low of $62,000. This downturn was initially triggered by the onset of the Iran-Israel conflict, causing substantial liquidations among crypto investors. With that in mind, Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish, ahead of Bitcoin haling event.Despite this, Bitcoin swiftly recouped its losses, propelled by the anticipation of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event around April 20—an event historically known to precipitate significant bullish momentum in the market.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies climbed to $2.42 trillion, reflecting a 24-hour increase of 4.76%. Alongside Bitcoin, other major cryptocurrencies like Polkadot and Uniswap witnessed over 10% gains. Nevertheless, the volatile market saw about $1.5 billion in bullish positions liquidated during the weekend, underscoring the high stakes and unpredictability amidst geopolitical tensions. This instability challenges the notion of cryptocurrencies as stable safe havens during global crises.Impact of Recent Bitcoin Transfers from Dormant Wallets on BTC Price Recent transfer of , after 14 years of dormancy, has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community. This significant transaction, now valued at over $3 million, reflects the early days of Bitcoin when each token was worth only a few dollars. This event is part of a trend where old Bitcoin wallets are becoming active again, hinting at potential market impacts and highlighting the historical significance of Bitcoin’s early years.Therefore, the recent transfer of 50 Bitcoins from a long-dormant wallet, along with similar movements from old Bitcoin wallets, could impact BTC’s price due to market attention and increased liquidity from these significant transactions.US Government’s Bitcoin Holdings and Validation for BTC Price Boost The U.S. government’s notable , valued at $15 billion, underscores Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a significant asset class. Such substantial investment not only boosts Bitcoin’s price but also enhances its appeal to potential investors, likely increasing market demand.https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1778741086418059740The visibility into these holdings, provided by platforms like Arkham, aids in demystifying the cryptocurrency landscape. This transparency encourages broader investor engagement and fosters positive sentiment towards Bitcoin, potentially leading to price appreciation.Positive market sentiment likely to drive Bitcoin’s price higher.Transparency in government holdings may increase investor participation.U.S. holds over $15 billion in Bitcoin, bolstering BTC’s legitimacy. Bitcoin Price Prediction  Today’s analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) reflects a moderate upswing, with its price currently at $65,990, marking a 0.50% increase. The cryptocurrency navigates a complex landscape, with its immediate pivot point set at $66,610. Surpassing this level could expose Bitcoin to resistance marks at $68,729, followed by $71,532, and potentially reaching up to $73,698. On the downside, crucial supports are positioned at $62,407, $58,829, and further down at $55,754, indicating substantial fallback zones if bearish trends take hold. Bitcoin Price PredictionTechnically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 suggests neutral momentum, neither particularly bullish nor bearish. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $68,566, hovering above the current price, suggesting that Bitcoin needs to surpass this average to regain a stronger bullish outlook.In summary, Bitcoin’s current technical stance indicates a tentative market with potential for volatility, contingent on breaking key resistance or support levels.Top 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2024  Stay up-to-date with the world of digital assets by exploring our handpicked collection of the best 15 alternative cryptocurrencies and ICO projects to keep an eye on in 2024.

       "  'description': 'Cardano has witnessed a substantial drop to the $0.4 region, suppressing the price by over 20%. Despite the dip, the ascent suggests a potential rally through the 200 EMA, challenging the downtrend with limited volatility and apathetic trade volume. Chart by TradingViewCardano\\'s price action has been a roller coaster, with its recent plunge to the $0.4 support level and a subsequent bounce back. At the time of writing, ADA has seen its value soar above $0.48, instilling a fresh wave of inflows into the market.It is noteworthy that the descent has not influenced the coin’s longer-term trend, which has been bearish with an absence of significant volume — a hint that the market is still in search of a solid direction. However, the surge above the 200 EMA will push the coin into the bullish zone once again.If ADA fails, the $0.4 level remains a crucial bastion of support, and its endurance will be critical in preventing further declines. However, if the marketwide recovery continues, there is a good possibility of a prolonged continuation of the rally.Shiba Inu takes hitShiba Inu has seen a sharp 30% decline. But one way or another, the only question in most holders\\' minds is: \"Will Shiba Inu really recover?\"The token\\'s dip to the $0.00002165 mark has been met with a mixture of concern and anticipation. A rebound from this level could signal a strong support base, potentially pivoting SHIB back into an uptrend.As for the chart, the Bollinger Bands have been preceding the drop as their narrowing was a strong signal of an upcoming price surge. Now, with SHIB having slipped below the crucial 50-day moving average, the only thing left is to wait for a return above this aforementioned level.Shiba Inu/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe trading activity is pretty quiet, which shows that people are not too confident about SHIB right now. The RSI is suggesting that selling pressure prevailed over buys on the market, pushing the value of the token down.SHIB will face its first big test at the $0.00002880 level. If it can go beyond that, we might see the price move up toward $0.00003.As for what\\'s next for SHIB, it is really tough to say, considering the lack of fundamental development around Shiba Inu. However, there is always the possibility of a further price reversal and the return of the buying power on the market in general, which is going to push the value of tokens like Shiba Inu further up - especially if the risk appetite among investors returns.Ethereum\\'s comebackEthereum has made a strong and sufficient comeback, easily returning above the $3,000 threshold. The pivot suggests that Ethereum could continue its path upward despite this minor setback.Following the dip that moved the market, the price action has been affirmative, reclaiming the $3,000 mark with conviction. This level now forms a bedrock of support, cementing the current price range.Specifically, the key support at approximately $2,700 is highlighted, a level where the asset has previously beaten the substantial buying pressure. The resistance can be found around the $3,600 zone.As the price started rising, the volume started moving up, showing a lot of interest on the market. This rise in trading, along with the clear increase in price, has helped the upward trend to gain strength.The intersection of technical indicators with market sentiment heralds a bullish scenario, where the previous peak at approximately $3,950 is not unreal.However, the most recent surge of volatility on the market might not go unnoticed, and it is important to avoid any risky moves that might drastically affect your portfolio.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Bitcoin halving is less than one week away, and Coinbase is hyping up the event with a new commercial released on Monday.Advertising the Halvingon X illustrating how much Bitcoin’s price has appreciated over time by measuring its purchasing power in terms of pizza.“Over time, your money gets you less. Does Bitcoin?” the ad’s narrator asks.Food for thought:What if money was designed to get you more over time, not less? — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) Back in 2010, early Bitcoin adopter Laszlo Hanyecz famously spent 10,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas, in what is widely known as the first-ever use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. By 2012, just one Bitcoin could purchase a pizza, and by 2020, Bitcoin was worth thousands of dollars per coin.“Roughly every four years, the future supply of Bitcoin is reduced,” the Coinbase ad said. “So historically, you get more, not less. Bitcoin moves money forward.”Coinbase refers to the “Bitcoin halving” in the video, when Bitcoin’s supply issuance rate is cut in half every 210,000 blocks. The next Bitcoin halving takes place at block 840,000 in approximately 4 days, and will reduce Bitcoin block payments to miners from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block.This effectively lowers to less than that of gold, to which the asset’s promoters often compare it to as a reliably scarce store of value. Historically, the event has also been followed by a sharp increase in Bitcoin’s price roughly 12 to 18 months later, theoretically due to the ensuing supply crunch.Even Bitcoin miners are bullish on the event, despite the fact that it will reduce their revenues in the short term.“The supply shock of the halving has historically been linked to exponential runs in the price of Bitcoin, which counteracts the impact on miner revenues,” an IREN spokesperson told Cryptonews last week.TD Bank Commercial Coinbase isn’t the only one promoting the halving: even the multinational bank TD last week emphasizing how Bitcoin’s halving creates a supply crunch.“Bitcoin was designed so only 21 million coins can be created, but instead of flooding the market with all the coins at once, the supply of new coins is slowly released into the market every day,” the commercial stated.By contrast, Coinbase released a report last year arguing that the halving isn’t as impactful on Bitcoin’s price as people think and that the crypto market is more impacted by macroeconomic cycles.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Norway is introducing a new legislation to regulate data centers nationwide and provide oversight on the activities of BTC miners, according to local Monday reports.The law mandates that all data centres register with the appropriate authorities and provide detailed information on services and ownership structure.BTC Miners Activities Set to be Filtered by Norway’s Legislationlocal media outlet VG, Norway’s ministries of digitalization and energy have drafted what they claim to be the first legislation in Europe to regulate the country’s ever-growing data center industry.JUST IN: Norway's new data center legislation suggests heightened scrutiny for Bitcoin miners, indicating potential regulatory challenges ahead. 🇳🇴 — Breaking Whale (@BreakingWhale) The country’s Energy Minister Terje Aasland disclosed the government’s position, stating that cryptocurrency-related data center businesses are not desired in Norway.“They are not welcome in Norway,” he said. “We want serious actors who are important to society, and the society-serving computer industry is important to us.”Aasland further noted that Northern Norway, known for its relatively inexpensive electricity, has seen a rise in data centers established for Bitcoin mining.This latest development from the Norwegian authorities aligns with a , which indicated that crypto mining operations in Northern Norway consume nearly as much electricity as the entire district of Lofoten, estimated to be home to 24,500 residents.The minister reiterated the role of data centers in Norway’s societal framework, particularly in securing storage for images and communication, which he considers integral to Norway’s development.Miners are attracted to Norway due to its . The Nordic region generates the second-highest amount of electricity per capita globally, with 100% of its energy coming from renewables.The country also offers low energy prices, averaging $10 and $50 per MWh (megawatt-hour) from 2013 to 2020.Aasland expressed disapproval of actors solely seeking to capitalize on cheap electricity in the region, as he stressed the importance of responsible energy use.If the legislation passes, it could increase scrutiny and regulatory challenges for BTC miners in the country as their electricity consumption may be regulated, similar to what’s been reported in the British Columbia Province in Canada. Those seeking to establish new mining operations or expand existing ones may face difficulties obtaining the necessary permits.BTC Miners Could Liquidate $5B After Halving Event Norway’s recent legislative focus on data centers coincides with growing concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining. These concerns were increased following a warning by 10x Research that BTC miners could liquidate up to $5 billion following the upcoming halving event.

       "  'description': 'Solana’s price saw a notable recovery on Monday after a steep decline over the past seven days. This was supported by positive developments in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets, which came alongside the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong.\\xa0Additionally, Solana addressed its ongoing network congestion issues with a new update, aiming to rectify transaction failures and outages.New Update Tackling Implementation BugAccording to Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, Solana’s recent network congestion issues were attributed to an implementation bug rather than a fundamental design flaw. Mumtaz clarified that Solana’s current predicament results from a flaw in implementing a specific protocol.\\xa0According to Anza, a spin-off of Solana Labs, Solana has released a new update to its validator client software to combat this. The update, v1.17.31, aims to reduce network congestion and will be followed by further improvements in v1.18.Anza emphasized the update’s significance, urging MainnetBeta validators to adopt it. The enhancements introduced in the update are expected to mitigate Solana’s ongoing network congestion issues.\\xa0Furthermore, validators were advised to upgrade their systems when there is less than 5% delinquent stake, ensuring they have sufficient time to monitor the node after the upgrade.Any issues encountered during the upgrade were to be reported to \\u2060mb-validators. Solana Status, a trusted source, corroborated the announcement, recommending the v1.17.31 release for general use.Trent.sol, Solana’s developer and operations manager, emphasized that the effectiveness of the update would be proportional to its adoption across the network.\\xa0While the improvements primarily target Solana’s Stake Weighted Quality of Service (SWQOS) and may not result in significant changes to the reliability of unstacked Tensor processing units (TPU) traffic, Solana users were advised to keep delinquency below 5% during the upgrade process.\\xa0Furthermore, Anza hinted at additional enhancements in the pipeline, urging users to stay tuned for further updates.Solana Price Rebounds With 7% SurgeAfter unveiling updates to enhance network efficiency, the Solana price has surged by over 7%. This surge has helped offset the ongoing downtrend experienced by Solana, which amounted to nearly 21% over the past month.\\xa0In addition, the Hong Kong SFC has officially approved\\xa0several spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including asset managers such as China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, HashKey Capital Limited, and an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments.\\xa0This regulatory approval has not only positively impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum but has also instilled a sense of positivity in the overall cryptocurrency market. As a result, the top 10 cryptocurrencies have witnessed significant uptrends, riding on the wave of these developments.Despite the recent surge in Solana’s price, SOL’s trading volume has decreased by -44.70% in the last 24 hours, indicating a recent decline in market activity, according to CoinGecko data.\\xa0Solana’s current trading price of $151.40 presents the first obstacle in the cryptocurrency’s path toward further price gains. If this hurdle is surpassed, the next significant resistance lies at $170, which would signify a recovery of SOL’s gains recorded over the past month.\\xa0On the other hand, the $130 mark has proven to be a strong support level for Solana, representing the foundation of SOL’s one-month bullish structure, which propelled its price rally to nearly three-year highs of $210 on March 18.Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com ',\n",

This suggests that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.Bitcoin However, the selling may not be over yet. Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x Research, said in a recent note that Bitcoin miners may offload $5 billion worth of Bitcoin over the four to six months post Bitcoin halving. That may keep Bitcoin “sideways for the next few months,” Thielen added.A sideways market usually traps both the bulls and the bears by giving false breakouts in both directions. Therefore, traders need to be careful and not jump to buy or sell at the first instance. It is better to wait for the breakout to sustain before taking large bets.What important resistance levels must Bitcoin cross to suggest that the correction may be over? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.S&P 500 Index price analysisThe S&P 500 Index nose-dived to the 50-day simple moving average (5,115) on April 12, signaling that the bears are trying to take charge.If the 50-day SMA gives way, the index could start a corrective phase. The first support on the downside is 4,900. A bounce off this level could face selling at the 20-day exponential moving average (5,174). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the possibility of a drop below 4,900 increases.If buyers want to prevent the decline, they will have to push the price back above the 20-day EMA.

On Saturday, in particular, BTC’s dominance jumped to 57% as it briefly touched the $67,000 mark.\\xa0The next largest tokens by market share include Ethereum (ETH), Tether’s USDT stablecoin, Binance exchange’s native token Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL).BTC’s Rise Fueled By Successful US Bitcoin ETF LaunchesAccording to Bloomberg, the recent success of the recently approved US spot Bitcoin ETFs from prominent issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s rise.\\xa0These ETFs have garnered approximately $56 billion in assets, making their debut one of the most successful in fund category history.The inflows into these ETFs drove BTC to its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,798 in mid-March, a clear resistance level for the largest cryptocurrency on the market, as evidenced by its inability to consolidate above the $70,000 level following this achievement.\\xa0Although BTC is down about 6% since then, smaller digital assets such as Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) have seen more significant declines of nearly 30% over the past month.\\xa0This drop coincided with reduced expectations for looser US monetary policy settings, often fueling speculative gains.Hong Kong-Listed ETFs Boosts Bitcoin And EthereumInstitutional investors’ allocations to the US Bitcoin ETF have greatly influenced Bitcoin’s performance relative to the rest of the market. Benjamin Celermajer, director of digital-asset investment at Magnet Capital, noted that strong institutional demand is a key driver.On Monday, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw notable price jumps following indications that asset managers are preparing to launch Hong Kong-listed ETFs on both tokens. Bitcoin rose 4.3% to $66,575, while ETH jumped 6.2% to $3,260.\\xa0These rallies had a positive impact on the broader crypto market, lifting other notable tokens such as Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), the dog-themed meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana, which is now the top 5 cryptocurrency market winner, up over 8% on Monday.Interestingly, the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of the largest digital assets traded in US dollars, has more than tripled since the beginning of last year, marking a significant rebound from the bear market experienced in 2022.Lastly, investors and traders eagerly anticipate the upcoming Bitcoin Halving, an event that will cut the new supply of the token in half, expected around April 20th.\\xa0Previous Halving events have acted as a tailwind for prices, although there are growing doubts about whether history will repeat itself given BTC’s recent all-time high achievement.\\xa0BTC has successfully maintained its position above the $66,000 threshold and has consolidated in this range. However, it is important to note that losses have accumulated over longer time frames.\\xa0Over the past fourteen and thirty days of trading, the cryptocurrency has experienced significant declines of over 21% and 24% respectively.Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com ',\n",
